ENTER CAMILLO AND ARCHIDAMUS.

  ARCH. IF YOU SHALL CHANCE (CAMILLO) TO VISIT BOHEMIA, ON
THE LIKE OCCASION WHEREON MY SERUICES ARE NOW
ON-FOOT, YOU SHALL SEE (AS I HAUE SAID) GREAT DIFFERENCE
BETWIXT OUR BOHEMIA, AND YOUR SICILIA

   CAM. I THINKE, THIS COMMING SUMMER, THE KING OF
SICILIA MEANES TO PAY BOHEMIA THE VISITATION, WHICH HEE
IUSTLY OWES HIM

   ARCH. WHEREIN OUR ENTERTAINMENT SHALL SHAME VS: WE
WILL BE IUSTIFIED IN OUR LOUES: FOR INDEED-
  CAM. 'BESEECH YOU-
  ARCH. VERELY I SPEAKE IT IN THE FREEDOME OF MY KNOWLEDGE:
WE CANNOT WITH SUCH MAGNIFICENCE- IN SO RARE-
I KNOW NOT WHAT TO SAY- WEE WILL GIUE YOU SLEEPIE
DRINKES, THAT YOUR SENCES (VN-INTELLIGENT OF OUR INSUFFICIENCE)
MAY, THOUGH THEY CANNOT PRAYSE VS, AS LITTLE ACCUSE
VS

   CAM. YOU PAY A GREAT DEALE TO DEARE, FOR WHAT'S GIUEN
FREELY

   ARCH. 'BELEEUE ME, I SPEAKE AS MY VNDERSTANDING INSTRUCTS
ME, AND AS MINE HONESTIE PUTS IT TO VTTERANCE

   CAM. SICILIA CANNOT SHEW HIMSELFE OUER-KIND TO BOHEMIA:
THEY WERE TRAYN'D TOGETHER IN THEIR CHILDHOODS;
AND THERE ROOTED BETWIXT THEM THEN SUCH AN AFFECTION,
WHICH CANNOT CHUSE BUT BRAUNCH NOW. SINCE THEIR MORE
MATURE DIGNITIES, AND ROYALL NECESSITIES, MADE SEPERATION
OF THEIR SOCIETIE, THEIR ENCOUNTERS (THOUGH NOT PERSONALL)
HATH BEEN ROYALLY ATTORNYED WITH ENTER-CHANGE OF
GIFTS, LETTERS, LOUING EMBASSIES, THAT THEY HAUE SEEM'D TO
BE TOGETHER, THOUGH ABSENT: SHOOKE HANDS, AS OUER A VAST;
AND EMBRAC'D AS IT WERE FROM THE ENDS OF OPPOSED WINDS.
THE HEAUENS CONTINUE THEIR LOUES

   ARCH. I THINKE THERE IS NOT IN THE WORLD, EITHER MALICE
OR MATTER, TO ALTER IT. YOU HAUE AN VNSPEAKABLE COMFORT
OF YOUR YOUNG PRINCE MAMILLIUS: IT IS A GENTLEMAN OF THE
GREATEST PROMISE, THAT EUER CAME INTO MY NOTE

   CAM. I VERY WELL AGREE WITH YOU, IN THE HOPES OF HIM:
IT IS A GALLANT CHILD; ONE, THAT (INDEED) PHYSICKS THE SUBIECT,
MAKES OLD HEARTS FRESH: THEY THAT WENT ON CRUTCHES
ERE HE WAS BORNE, DESIRE YET THEIR LIFE, TO SEE HIM A MAN

   ARCH. WOULD THEY ELSE BE CONTENT TO DIE?
  CAM. YES; IF THERE WERE NO OTHER EXCUSE, WHY THEY SHOULD
DESIRE TO LIUE

   ARCH. IF THE KING HAD NO SONNE, THEY WOULD DESIRE TO
LIUE ON CRUTCHES TILL HE HAD ONE.

EXEUNT.

   HER. WAS NOT MY LORD
THE VERYER WAG O'TH' TWO?
  POL. WE WERE AS TWYN'D LAMBS, THAT DID FRISK I'TH' SUN,
AND BLEAT THE ONE AT TH' OTHER: WHAT WE CHANG'D,
WAS INNOCENCE, FOR INNOCENCE: WE KNEW NOT
THE DOCTRINE OF ILL-DOING, NOR DREAM'D
THAT ANY DID: HAD WE PURSU'D THAT LIFE,
AND OUR WEAKE SPIRITS NE'RE BEEN HIGHER REAR'D
WITH STRONGER BLOOD, WE SHOULD HAUE ANSWER'D HEAUEN
BOLDLY, NOT GUILTY; THE IMPOSITION CLEAR'D,
HEREDITARIE OURS

   HER. NEUER?
  LEO. NEUER, BUT ONCE

   HER. WHAT? HAUE I TWICE SAID WELL? WHEN WAS'T BEFORE?

SLAUGHTERS A THOUSAND, WAYTING VPON THAT.
OUR PRAYSES ARE OUR WAGES. YOU MAY RIDE'S
WITH ONE SOFT KISSE A THOUSAND FURLONGS, ERE
WITH SPUR WE HEAT AN ACRE. BUT TO TH' GOALE:
MY LAST GOOD DEED, WAS TO ENTREAT HIS STAY.
WHAT WAS MY FIRST? IT HA'S AN ELDER SISTER,
OR I MISTAKE YOU: O, WOULD HER NAME WERE GRACE.
BUT ONCE BEFORE I SPOKE TO TH' PURPOSE? WHEN?
NAY, LET ME HAUE'T: I LONG

I AM YOURS FOR EUER

   HER. 'TIS GRACE INDEED.
WHY LO-YOU NOW; I HAUE SPOKE TO TH' PURPOSE TWICE:
THE ONE, FOR EUER EARN'D A ROYALL HUSBAND;

   LEO. TOO HOT, TOO HOT:
TO MINGLE FRIENDSHIP FARRE, IS MINGLING BLOODS.
I HAUE TREMOR CORDIS ON ME: MY HEART DAUNCES,
BUT NOT FOR IOY; NOT IOY. THIS ENTERTAINMENT
MAY A FREE FACE PUT ON: DERIUE A LIBERTIE
FROM HEARTINESSE, FROM BOUNTIE, FERTILE BOSOME,
AND WELL BECOME THE AGENT: 'T MAY; I GRAUNT:
BUT TO BE PADLING PALMES, AND PINCHING FINGERS,
AS NOW THEY ARE, AND MAKING PRACTIS'D SMILES
AS IN A LOOKING-GLASSE; AND THEN TO SIGH, AS 'TWERE
THE MORT O'TH' DEERE: OH, THAT IS ENTERTAINMENT

  MAM. I, MY GOOD LORD

   LEO. I'FECKS:
WHY THAT'S MY BAWCOCK: WHAT? HAS'T SMUTCH'D THY NOSE?
THEY SAY IT IS A COPPY OUT OF MINE. COME CAPTAINE,
WE MUST BE NEAT; NOT NEAT, BUT CLEANLY, CAPTAINE:
AND YET THE STEERE, THE HEYCFER, AND THE CALFE,
ARE ALL CALL'D NEAT. STILL VIRGINALLING
VPON HIS PALME? HOW NOW (YOU WANTON CALFE)
ART THOU MY CALFE?
  MAM. YES, IF YOU WILL (MY LORD.)
  LEO. THOU WANT'ST A ROUGH PASH, & THE SHOOTS THAT I HAUE
TO BE FULL, LIKE ME: YET THEY SAY WE ARE
ALMOST AS LIKE AS EGGES; WOMEN SAY SO,
(THAT WILL SAY ANY THING.) BUT WERE THEY FALSE
AS O'RE-DY'D BLACKS, AS WIND, AS WATERS; FALSE
AS DICE ARE TO BE WISH'D, BY ONE THAT FIXES
NO BORNE 'TWIXT HIS AND MINE; YET WERE IT TRUE,
TO SAY THIS BOY WERE LIKE ME. COME (SIR PAGE)
LOOKE ON ME WITH YOUR WELKIN EYE: SWEET VILLAINE,
MOST DEAR'ST, MY COLLOP: CAN THY DAM, MAY'T BE
AFFECTION? THY INTENTION STABS THE CENTER.
THOU DO'ST MAKE POSSIBLE THINGS NOT SO HELD,
COMMUNICAT'ST WITH DREAMES (HOW CAN THIS BE?)
WITH WHAT'S VNREALL: THOU COACTIUE ART,
AND FELLOW'ST NOTHING. THEN 'TIS VERY CREDENT,
THOU MAY'ST CO-IOYNE WITH SOMETHING, AND THOU DO'ST,
(AND THAT BEYOND COMMISSION) AND I FIND IT,
(AND THAT TO THE INFECTION OF MY BRAINES,
AND HARDNING OF MY BROWES.)
  POL. WHAT MEANES SICILIA?
  HER. HE SOMETHING SEEMES VNSETLED

   POL. HOW? MY LORD?
  LEO. WHAT CHEERE? HOW IS'T WITH YOU, BEST BROTHER?
  HER. YOU LOOK AS IF YOU HELD A BROW OF MUCH DISTRACTION:
ARE YOU MOU'D (MY LORD?)
  LEO. NO, IN GOOD EARNEST.
HOW SOMETIMES NATURE WILL BETRAY IT'S FOLLY?
IT'S TENDERNESSE? AND MAKE IT SELFE A PASTIME
TO HARDER BOSOMES? LOOKING ON THE LYNES
OF MY BOYES FACE, ME THOUGHTS I DID REQUOYLE
TWENTIE THREE YEERES, AND SAW MY SELFE VN-BREECH'D,
IN MY GREENE VELUET COAT; MY DAGGER MUZZEL'D,

WILL YOU TAKE EGGES FOR MONEY?
  MAM. NO (MY LORD) ILE FIGHT

   LEO. YOU WILL: WHY HAPPY MAN BE'S DOLE. MY BROTHER

  POL. IF AT HOME (SIR)

LET WHAT IS DEARE IN SICILY, BE CHEAPE:
NEXT TO THY SELFE, AND MY YOUNG ROUER, HE'S
APPARANT TO MY HEART

   HER. IF YOU WOULD SEEKE VS,
WE ARE YOURS I'TH' GARDEN: SHALL'S ATTEND YOU THERE?
  LEO. TO YOUR OWNE BENTS DISPOSE YOU: YOU'LE BE FOUND,
BE YOU BENEATH THE SKY: I AM ANGLING NOW,
(THOUGH YOU PERCEIUE ME NOT HOW I GIUE LYNE)
GOE TOO, GOE TOO.
HOW SHE HOLDS VP THE NEB? THE BYLL TO HIM?
AND ARMES HER WITH THE BOLDNESSE OF A WIFE
TO HER ALLOWING HUSBAND. GONE ALREADY,
YNCH-THICK, KNEE-DEEPE; ORE HEAD AND EARES A FORK'D ONE.
GOE PLAY (BOY) PLAY: THY MOTHER PLAYES, AND I
PLAY TOO; BUT SO DISGRAC'D A PART, WHOSE ISSUE
WILL HISSE ME TO MY GRAUE: CONTEMPT AND CLAMOR
WILL BE MY KNELL. GOE PLAY (BOY) PLAY, THERE HAUE BEEN

AND MANY A MAN THERE IS (EUEN AT THIS PRESENT,
NOW, WHILE I SPEAKE THIS) HOLDS HIS WIFE BY TH' ARME,
THAT LITTLE THINKES SHE HA'S BEEN SLUYC'D IN'S ABSENCE,
AND HIS POND FISH'D BY HIS NEXT NEIGHBOR (BY
SIR SMILE, HIS NEIGHBOR:) NAY, THERE'S COMFORT IN'T,
WHILES OTHER MEN HAUE GATES, AND THOSE GATES OPEN'D
(AS MINE) AGAINST THEIR WILL. SHOULD ALL DESPAIRE
THAT HAUE REUOLTED WIUES, THE TENTH OF MANKIND
WOULD HANG THEMSELUES. PHYSICK FOR'T, THERE'S NONE:
IT IS A BAWDY PLANET, THAT WILL STRIKE
WHERE 'TIS PREDOMINANT; AND 'TIS POWREFULL: THINKE IT:
FROM EAST, WEST, NORTH, AND SOUTH, BE IT CONCLUDED,
NO BARRICADO FOR A BELLY. KNOW'T,

   CAM. YOU HAD MUCH ADOE TO MAKE HIS ANCHOR HOLD,
WHEN YOU CAST OUT, IT STILL CAME HOME

   LEO. DIDST NOTE IT?
  CAM. HE WOULD NOT STAY AT YOUR PETITIONS, MADE
HIS BUSINESSE MORE MATERIALL

   LEO. DIDST PERCEIUE IT?
THEY'RE HERE WITH ME ALREADY; WHISP'RING, ROUNDING:
SICILIA IS A SO-FORTH: 'TIS FARRE GONE,
WHEN I SHALL GUST IT LAST. HOW CAM'T (CAMILLO)
THAT HE DID STAY?
  CAM. AT THE GOOD QUEENES ENTREATIE

   LEO. AT THE QUEENES BE'T: GOOD SHOULD BE PERTINENT,
BUT SO IT IS, IT IS NOT. WAS THIS TAKEN
BY ANY VNDERSTANDING PATE BUT THINE?
FOR THY CONCEIT IS SOAKING, WILL DRAW IN
MORE THEN THE COMMON BLOCKS. NOT NOTED, IS'T,
BUT OF THE FINER NATURES? BY SOME SEUERALLS
OF HEAD-PEECE EXTRAORDINARIE? LOWER MESSES
PERCHANCE ARE TO THIS BUSINESSE PURBLIND? SAY

   CAM. BUSINESSE, MY LORD? I THINKE MOST VNDERSTAND
BOHEMIA STAYES HERE LONGER

   LEO. HA?
  CAM. STAYES HERE LONGER

   LEO. I, BUT WHY?
  CAM. TO SATISFIE YOUR HIGHNESSE, AND THE ENTREATIES
OF OUR MOST GRACIOUS MISTRESSE

   LEO. SATISFIE?
TH' ENTREATIES OF YOUR MISTRESSE? SATISFIE?
LET THAT SUFFICE. I HAUE TRUSTED THEE (CAMILLO)
WITH ALL THE NEEREST THINGS TO MY HEART, AS WELL
MY CHAMBER-COUNCELS, WHEREIN (PRIEST-LIKE) THOU
HAST CLEANS'D MY BOSOME: I, FROM THEE DEPARTED
THY PENITENT REFORM'D: BUT WE HAUE BEEN
DECEIU'D IN THY INTEGRITIE, DECEIU'D
IN THAT WHICH SEEMES SO

   CAM. BE IT FORBID (MY LORD.)
  LEO. TO BIDE VPON'T: THOU ART NOT HONEST: OR
IF THOU INCLIN'ST THAT WAY, THOU ART A COWARD,
WHICH HOXES HONESTIE BEHIND, RESTRAYNING
FROM COURSE REQUIR'D: OR ELSE THOU MUST BE COUNTED
A SERUANT, GRAFTED IN MY SERIOUS TRUST,
AND THEREIN NEGLIGENT: OR ELSE A FOOLE,
THAT SEEST A GAME PLAY'D HOME, THE RICH STAKE DRAWNE,
AND TAK'ST IT ALL FOR IEAST

   CAM. MY GRACIOUS LORD,
I MAY BE NEGLIGENT, FOOLISH, AND FEAREFULL,
IN EUERY ONE OF THESE, NO MAN IS FREE,
BUT THAT HIS NEGLIGENCE, HIS FOLLY, FEARE,
AMONG THE INFINITE DOINGS OF THE WORLD,
SOMETIME PUTS FORTH IN YOUR AFFAIRES (MY LORD.)
IF EUER I WERE WILFULL-NEGLIGENT,
IT WAS MY FOLLY: IF INDUSTRIOUSLY
I PLAY'D THE FOOLE, IT WAS MY NEGLIGENCE,
NOT WEIGHING WELL THE END: IF EUER FEAREFULL
TO DOE A THING, WHERE I THE ISSUE DOUBTED,
WHEREOF THE EXECUTION DID CRY OUT
AGAINST THE NON-PERFORMANCE, 'TWAS A FEARE
WHICH OFT INFECTS THE WISEST: THESE (MY LORD)
ARE SUCH ALLOW'D INFIRMITIES, THAT HONESTIE
IS NEUER FREE OF. BUT BESEECH YOUR GRACE
BE PLAINER WITH ME, LET ME KNOW MY TRESPAS
BY IT'S OWNE VISAGE; IF I THEN DENY IT,
'TIS NONE OF MINE

   LEO. HA' NOT YOU SEENE CAMILLO?
(BUT THAT'S PAST DOUBT: YOU HAUE, OR YOUR EYE-GLASSE
IS THICKER THEN A CUCKOLDS HORNE) OR HEARD?
(FOR TO A VISION SO APPARANT, RUMOR
CANNOT BE MUTE) OR THOUGHT? (FOR COGITATION
RESIDES NOT IN THAT MAN, THAT DO'S NOT THINKE)
MY WIFE IS SLIPPERIE? IF THOU WILT CONFESSE,
OR ELSE BE IMPUDENTLY NEGATIUE,
TO HAUE NOR EYES, NOR EARES, NOR THOUGHT, THEN SAY
MY WIFE'S A HOLY-HORSE, DESERUES A NAME
AS RANKE AS ANY FLAX-WENCH, THAT PUTS TO
BEFORE HER TROTH-PLIGHT: SAY'T, AND IUSTIFY'T

   CAM. I WOULD NOT BE A STANDER-BY, TO HEARE
MY SOUERAIGNE MISTRESSE CLOUDED SO, WITHOUT
MY PRESENT VENGEANCE TAKEN: 'SHREW MY HEART,
YOU NEUER SPOKE WHAT DID BECOME YOU LESSE
THEN THIS; WHICH TO REITERATE, WERE SIN
AS DEEPE AS THAT, THOUGH TRUE

   LEO. IS WHISPERING NOTHING?
IS LEANING CHEEKE TO CHEEKE? IS MEATING NOSES?
KISSING WITH IN-SIDE LIP? STOPPING THE CARIERE
OF LAUGHTER, WITH A SIGH? (A NOTE INFALLIBLE
OF BREAKING HONESTIE) HORSING FOOT ON FOOT?
SKULKING IN CORNERS? WISHING CLOCKS MORE SWIFT?
HOURES, MINUTES? NOONE, MID-NIGHT? AND ALL EYES
BLIND WITH THE PIN AND WEB, BUT THEIRS; THEIRS ONELY,
THAT WOULD VNSEENE BE WICKED? IS THIS NOTHING?
WHY THEN THE WORLD, AND ALL THAT'S IN'T, IS NOTHING,
THE COUERING SKIE IS NOTHING, BOHEMIA NOTHING,
MY WIFE IS NOTHING, NOR NOTHING HAUE THESE NOTHINGS,
IF THIS BE NOTHING

   CAM. GOOD MY LORD, BE CUR'D
OF THIS DISEAS'D OPINION, AND BETIMES,
FOR 'TIS MOST DANGEROUS

   LEO. SAY IT BE, 'TIS TRUE

   CAM. NO, NO, MY LORD

   LEO. IT IS: YOU LYE, YOU LYE:
I SAY THOU LYEST CAMILLO, AND I HATE THEE,
PRONOUNCE THEE A GROSSE LOWT, A MINDLESSE SLAUE,
OR ELSE A HOUERING TEMPORIZER, THAT
CANST WITH THINE EYES AT ONCE SEE GOOD AND EUILL,
INCLINING TO THEM BOTH: WERE MY WIUES LIUER
INFECTED (AS HER LIFE) SHE WOULD NOT LIUE
THE RUNNING OF ONE GLASSE

   CAM. WHO DO'S INFECT HER?
  LEO. WHY HE THAT WEARES HER LIKE HER MEDULL, HANGING
ABOUT HIS NECK (BOHEMIA) WHO, IF I
HAD SERUANTS TRUE ABOUT ME, THAT BARE EYES
TO SEE ALIKE MINE HONOR, AS THEIR PROFITS,
(THEIR OWNE PARTICULAR THRIFTS) THEY WOULD DOE THAT
WHICH SHOULD VNDOE MORE DOING: I, AND THOU
HIS CUP-BEARER, WHOM I FROM MEANER FORME
HAUE BENCH'D, AND REAR'D TO WORSHIP, WHO MAY'ST SEE
PLAINELY, AS HEAUEN SEES EARTH, AND EARTH SEES HEAUEN,
HOW I AM GALL'D, MIGHT'ST BE-SPICE A CUP,
TO GIUE MINE ENEMY A LASTING WINKE:
WHICH DRAUGHT TO ME, WERE CORDIALL

   CAM. SIR (MY LORD)
I COULD DOE THIS, AND THAT WITH NO RASH POTION,
BUT WITH A LINGRING DRAM, THAT SHOULD NOT WORKE
MALICIOUSLY, LIKE POYSON: BUT I CANNOT
BELEEUE THIS CRACK TO BE IN MY DREAD MISTRESSE
(SO SOUERAIGNELY BEING HONORABLE.)
I HAUE LOU'D THEE,
  LEO. MAKE THAT THY QUESTION, AND GOE ROT:
DO'ST THINKE I AM SO MUDDY, SO VNSETLED,
TO APPOINT MY SELFE IN THIS VEXATION?
SULLY THE PURITIE AND WHITENESSE OF MY SHEETES
(WHICH TO PRESERUE, IS SLEEPE; WHICH BEING SPOTTED,
IS GOADES, THORNES, NETTLES, TAYLES OF WASPES)
GIUE SCANDALL TO THE BLOOD O'TH' PRINCE, MY SONNE,
(WHO I DOE THINKE IS MINE, AND LOUE AS MINE)
WITHOUT RIPE MOUING TO'T? WOULD I DOE THIS?
COULD MAN SO BLENCH?
  CAM. I MUST BELEEUE YOU (SIR)
I DOE, AND WILL FETCH OFF BOHEMIA FOR'T:
PROUIDED, THAT WHEN HEE'S REMOU'D, YOUR HIGHNESSE
WILL TAKE AGAINE YOUR QUEENE, AS YOURS AT FIRST,
EUEN FOR YOUR SONNES SAKE, AND THEREBY FOR SEALING
THE INIURIE OF TONGUES, IN COURTS AND KINGDOMES
KNOWNE, AND ALLY'D TO YOURS

   LEO. THOU DO'ST ADUISE ME,
EUEN SO AS I MINE OWNE COURSE HAUE SET DOWNE:
ILE GIUE NO BLEMISH TO HER HONOR, NONE

   CAM. MY LORD,
GOE THEN; AND WITH A COUNTENANCE AS CLEARE
AS FRIENDSHIP WEARES AT FEASTS, KEEPE WITH BOHEMIA,
AND WITH YOUR QUEENE: I AM HIS CUP-BEARER,
IF FROM ME HE HAUE WHOLESOME BEUERIDGE,
ACCOUNT ME NOT YOUR SERUANT

   LEO. THIS IS ALL:
DO'T, AND THOU HAST THE ONE HALFE OF MY HEART;
DO'T NOT, THOU SPLITT'ST THINE OWNE

   CAM. ILE DO'T, MY LORD

   LEO. I WIL SEEME FRIENDLY, AS THOU HAST ADUIS'D ME.

EXIT

  CAM. O MISERABLE LADY. BUT FOR ME,
WHAT CASE STAND I IN? I MUST BE THE POYSONER
OF GOOD POLIXENES, AND MY GROUND TO DO'T,
IS THE OBEDIENCE TO A MASTER; ONE,
WHO IN REBELLION WITH HIMSELFE, WILL HAUE
ALL THAT ARE HIS, SO TOO. TO DOE THIS DEED,
PROMOTION FOLLOWES: IF I COULD FIND EXAMPLE
OF THOUSAND'S THAT HAD STRUCK ANOYNTED KINGS,
AND FLOURISH'D AFTER, IL'D NOT DO'T: BUT SINCE
NOR BRASSE, NOR STONE, NOR PARCHMENT BEARES NOT ONE,
LET VILLANIE IT SELFE FORSWEAR'T. I MUST
FORSAKE THE COURT: TO DO'T, OR NO, IS CERTAINE

A LIPPE OF MUCH CONTEMPT, SPEEDES FROM ME, AND
SO LEAUES ME, TO CONSIDER WHAT IS BREEDING,
THAT CHANGES THUS HIS MANNERS

   CAM. I DARE NOT KNOW (MY LORD.)
  POL. HOW, DARE NOT? DOE NOT? DOE YOU KNOW, AND DARE NOT?

AS YOU ARE CERTAINELY A GENTLEMAN, THERETO
CLERKE-LIKE EXPERIENC'D, WHICH NO LESSE ADORNES

IN WHOSE SUCCESSE WE ARE GENTLE: I BESEECH YOU,
IF YOU KNOW OUGHT WHICH DO'S BEHOUE MY KNOWLEDGE,
THEREOF TO BE INFORM'D, IMPRISON'T NOT
IN IGNORANT CONCEALEMENT

   CAM. I MAY NOT ANSWERE

   POL. A SICKNESSE CAUGHT OF ME, AND YET I WELL?
I MUST BE ANSWER'D. DO'ST THOU HEARE CAMILLO,
I CONIURE THEE, BY ALL THE PARTS OF MAN,
WHICH HONOR DO'S ACKNOWLEDGE, WHEREOF THE LEAST
IS NOT THIS SUIT OF MINE, THAT THOU DECLARE
WHAT INCIDENCIE THOU DO'ST GHESSE OF HARME
IS CREEPING TOWARD ME; HOW FARRE OFF, HOW NEERE,

IF NOT, HOW BEST TO BEARE IT

   CAM. SIR, I WILL TELL YOU,
SINCE I AM CHARG'D IN HONOR, AND BY HIM
THAT I THINKE HONORABLE: THEREFORE MARKE MY COUNSAILE,
WHICH MUST BE EU'N AS SWIFTLY FOLLOWED, AS

CRY LOST, AND SO GOOD NIGHT

   POL. ON, GOOD CAMILLO

   CAM. I AM APPOINTED HIM TO MURTHER YOU

   POL. BY WHOM, CAMILLO?
  CAM. BY THE KING

   POL. FOR WHAT?
  CAM. HE THINKES, NAY WITH ALL CONFIDENCE HE SWEARES,
AS HE HAD SEEN'T, OR BEENE AN INSTRUMENT
TO VICE YOU TO'T, THAT YOU HAUE TOUCHT HIS QUEENE
FORBIDDENLY

   POL. OH THEN, MY BEST BLOOD TURNE

THAT ERE WAS HEARD, OR READ

   CAM. SWEARE HIS THOUGHT OUER
BY EACH PARTICULAR STARRE IN HEAUEN, AND

THE FABRICK OF HIS FOLLY, WHOSE FOUNDATION
IS PYL'D VPON HIS FAITH, AND WILL CONTINUE

BY THIS DISCOUERIE LOST.) BE NOT VNCERTAINE,
FOR BY THE HONOR OF MY PARENTS, I

MUST IT BE VIOLENT: AND, AS HE DO'S CONCEIUE,
HE IS DISHONOR'D BY A MAN, WHICH EUER
PROFESS'D TO HIM: WHY HIS REUENGES MUST
IN THAT BE MADE MORE BITTER. FEARE ORE-SHADES ME:
GOOD EXPEDITION BE MY FRIEND, AND COMFORT
THE GRACIOUS QUEENE, PART OF HIS THEAME; BUT NOTHING
OF HIS ILL-TA'NE SUSPITION. COME CAMILLO,
I WILL RESPECT THEE AS A FATHER, IF
THOU BEAR'ST MY LIFE OFF, HENCE: LET VS AUOID

   CAM. IT IS IN MINE AUTHORITIE TO COMMAND

ALACK, FOR LESSER KNOWLEDGE, HOW ACCURS'D,
IN BEING SO BLEST? THERE MAY BE IN THE CUP
A SPIDER STEEP'D, AND ONE MAY DRINKE; DEPART,

TH' ABHOR'D INGREDIENT TO HIS EYE, MAKE KNOWNE
HOW HE HATH DRUNKE, HE CRACKS HIS GORGE, HIS SIDES
WITH VIOLENT HEFTS: I HAUE DRUNKE, AND SEENE THE SPIDER.
CAMILLO WAS HIS HELPE IN THIS, HIS PANDAR:

WHOM I EMPLOY'D, WAS PRE-EMPLOY'D BY HIM:
HE HA'S DISCOUER'D MY DESIGNE, AND I

  LORD. BY HIS GREAT AUTHORITY,

   LEO. YOU HAUE MISTOOKE (MY LADY)
POLIXENES FOR LEONTES: O THOU THING,

LEAST BARBARISME (MAKING ME THE PRECEDENT)
SHOULD A LIKE LANGUAGE VSE TO ALL DEGREES,
AND MANNERLY DISTINGUISHMENT LEAUE OUT,
BETWIXT THE PRINCE AND BEGGER:) I HAUE SAID
SHEE'S AN ADULTRESSE, I HAUE SAID WITH WHOM:

A FEDERARIE WITH HER, AND ONE THAT KNOWES
WHAT SHE SHOULD SHAME TO KNOW HER SELFE,

PRIUY TO NONE OF THIS: HOW WILL THIS GRIEUE YOU,
WHEN YOU SHALL COME TO CLEARER KNOWLEDGE, THAT

A SCHOOLE-BOYES TOP. AWAY WITH HER, TO PRISON:

BUT THAT HE SPEAKES

   HER. THERE'S SOME ILL PLANET RAIGNES:

MY WOMEN MAY BE WITH ME, FOR YOU SEE
MY PLIGHT REQUIRES IT. DOE NOT WEEPE (GOOD FOOLES)
THERE IS NO CAUSE: WHEN YOU SHALL KNOW YOUR MISTRIS
HA'S DESERU'D PRISON, THEN ABOUND IN TEARES,
AS I COME OUT; THIS ACTION I NOW GOE ON,
IS FOR MY BETTER GRACE. ADIEU (MY LORD)
I NEUER WISH'D TO SEE YOU SORRY, NOW

I HAUE THREE DAUGHTERS: THE ELDEST IS ELEUEN;
THE SECOND, AND THE THIRD, NINE: AND SOME FIUE:
IF THIS PROUE TRUE, THEY'L PAY FOR'T. BY MINE HONOR
ILE GELL'D EM ALL: FOURTEENE THEY SHALL NOT SEE

BUT ONELY SEEING, ALL OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES
MADE VP TO'TH DEED) DOTH PUSH-ON THIS PROCEEDING.

MOST PITTEOUS TO BE WILDE) I HAUE DISPATCH'D IN POST,
TO SACRED DELPHOS, TO APPOLLO'S TEMPLE,
CLEOMINES AND DION, WHOM YOU KNOW

GIUE REST TO TH' MINDES OF OTHERS; SUCH AS HE
WHOSE IGNORANT CREDULITIE, WILL NOT
COME VP TO TH' TRUTH. SO HAUE WE THOUGHT IT GOOD
FROM OUR FREE PERSON, SHE SHOULD BE CONFINDE,

IN COMMITTING ADULTERY WITH POLIXENES KING OF BOHEMIA,
AND CONSPIRING WITH CAMILLO TO TAKE AWAY THE LIFE OF OUR
SOUERAIGNE
LORD THE KING, THY ROYALL HUSBAND: THE PRETENCE WHEREOF
BEING BY CIRCUMSTANCES PARTLY LAYD OPEN, THOU (HERMIONE) CONTRARY
TO THE FAITH AND ALLEGEANCE OF A TRUE SUBIECT, DIDST COUNSAILE
AND AYDE THEM, FOR THEIR BETTER SAFETIE, TO FLYE AWAY BY
NIGHT

   HER. SINCE WHAT I AM TO SAY, MUST BE BUT THAT
WHICH CONTRADICTS MY ACCUSATION, AND
THE TESTIMONIE ON MY PART, NO OTHER
BUT WHAT COMES FROM MY SELFE, IT SHALL SCARCE BOOT ME
TO SAY, NOT GUILTIE: MINE INTEGRITIE
BEING COUNTED FALSEHOOD, SHALL (AS I EXPRESSE IT)

BEHOLD OUR HUMANE ACTIONS (AS THEY DOE)
I DOUBT NOT THEN, BUT INNOCENCE SHALL MAKE
FALSE ACCUSATION BLUSH, AND TYRANNIE
TREMBLE AT PATIENCE. YOU (MY LORD) BEST KNOW

HATH BEENE AS CONTINENT, AS CHASTE, AS TRUE,
AS I AM NOW VNHAPPY; WHICH IS MORE
THEN HISTORIE CAN PATTERNE, THOUGH DEUIS'D,

A MOITIE OF THE THRONE: A GREAT KINGS DAUGHTER,
THE MOTHER TO A HOPEFULL PRINCE, HERE STANDING
TO PRATE AND TALKE FOR LIFE, AND HONOR, FORE
WHO PLEASE TO COME, AND HEARE. FOR LIFE, I PRIZE IT
AS I WEIGH GRIEFE (WHICH I WOULD SPARE:) FOR HONOR,
'TIS A DERIUATIUE FROM ME TO MINE,
AND ONELY THAT I STAND FOR. I APPEALE
TO YOUR OWNE CONSCIENCE (SIR) BEFORE POLIXENES
CAME TO YOUR COURT, HOW I WAS IN YOUR GRACE,
HOW MERITED TO BE SO: SINCE HE CAME,
WITH WHAT ENCOUNTER SO VNCURRANT, I
HAUE STRAYN'D T' APPEARE THUS; IF ONE IOT BEYOND

THAT WAY ENCLINING, HARDNED BE THE HEARTS
OF ALL THAT HEARE ME, AND MY NEER'ST OF KIN
CRY FIE VPON MY GRAUE

   LEO. I NE'RE HEARD YET,
THAT ANY OF THESE BOLDER VICES WANTED
LESSE IMPUDENCE TO GAINE-SAY WHAT THEY DID,
THEN TO PERFORME IT FIRST

   HER. THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH,
THOUGH 'TIS A SAYING (SIR) NOT DUE TO ME

   LEO. YOU WILL NOT OWNE IT

   HER. MORE THEN MISTRESSE OF,
WHICH COMES TO ME IN NAME OF FAULT, I MUST NOT

I LOU'D HIM, AS IN HONOR HE REQUIR'D:
WITH SUCH A KIND OF LOUE, AS MIGHT BECOME
A LADY LIKE ME; WITH A LOUE, EUEN SUCH,
SO, AND NO OTHER, AS YOUR SELFE COMMANDED:
WHICH, NOT TO HAUE DONE, I THINKE HAD BEEN IN ME
BOTH DISOBEDIENCE, AND INGRATITUDE
TO YOU, AND TOWARD YOUR FRIEND, WHOSE LOUE HAD SPOKE,
EUEN SINCE IT COULD SPEAKE, FROM AN INFANT, FREELY,
THAT IT WAS YOURS. NOW FOR CONSPIRACIE,
I KNOW NOT HOW IT TASTES, THOUGH IT BE DISH'D
FOR ME TO TRY HOW: ALL I KNOW OF IT,
IS, THAT CAMILLO WAS AN HONEST MAN;
AND WHY HE LEFT YOUR COURT, THE GODS THEMSELUES
(WOTTING NO MORE THEN I) ARE IGNORANT

   LEO. YOU KNEW OF HIS DEPARTURE, AS YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU HAUE VNDERTA'NE TO DOE IN'S ABSENCE

   HER. SIR,
YOU SPEAKE A LANGUAGE THAT I VNDERSTAND NOT:
MY LIFE STANDS IN THE LEUELL OF YOUR DREAMES,
WHICH ILE LAY DOWNE

   LEO. YOUR ACTIONS ARE MY DREAMES.
YOU HAD A BASTARD BY POLIXENES,
AND I BUT DREAM'D IT: AS YOU WERE PAST ALL SHAME,
(THOSE OF YOUR FACT ARE SO) SO PAST ALL TRUTH;
WHICH TO DENY, CONCERNES MORE THEN AUAILES: FOR AS
THY BRAT HATH BEEN CAST OUT, LIKE TO IT SELFE,
NO FATHER OWNING IT (WHICH IS INDEED
MORE CRIMINALL IN THEE, THEN IT) SO THOU
SHALT FEELE OUR IUSTICE; IN WHOSE EASIEST PASSAGE,
LOOKE FOR NO LESSE THEN DEATH

   HER. SIR, SPARE YOUR THREATS:
THE BUGGE WHICH YOU WOULD FRIGHT ME WITH, I SEEKE:
TO ME CAN LIFE BE NO COMMODITIE;
THE CROWNE AND COMFORT OF MY LIFE (YOUR FAUOR)
I DOE GIUE LOST, FOR I DOE FEELE IT GONE,
BUT KNOW NOT HOW IT WENT. MY SECOND IOY,
AND FIRST FRUITS OF MY BODY, FROM HIS PRESENCE
I AM BAR'D, LIKE ONE INFECTIOUS. MY THIRD COMFORT
(STAR'D MOST VNLUCKILY) IS FROM MY BREAST
(THE INNOCENT MILKE IN IT MOST INNOCENT MOUTH)
HAL'D OUT TO MURTHER. MY SELFE ON EUERY POST
PROCLAYM'D A STRUMPET: WITH IMMODEST HATRED
THE CHILD-BED PRIUILEDGE DENY'D, WHICH LONGS
TO WOMEN OF ALL FASHION. LASTLY, HURRIED
HERE, TO THIS PLACE, I'TH' OPEN AYRE, BEFORE
I HAUE GOT STRENGTH OF LIMIT. NOW (MY LIEGE)
TELL ME WHAT BLESSINGS I HAUE HERE ALIUE,
THAT I SHOULD FEARE TO DIE? THEREFORE PROCEED:
BUT YET HEARE THIS: MISTAKE ME NOT: NO LIFE,
(I PRIZE IT NOT A STRAW) BUT FOR MINE HONOR,
WHICH I WOULD FREE: IF I SHALL BE CONDEMN'D
VPON SURMIZES (ALL PROOFES SLEEPING ELSE,
BUT WHAT YOUR IEALOUSIES AWAKE) I TELL YOU
'TIS RIGOR, AND NOT LAW. YOUR HONORS ALL,
I DOE REFERRE ME TO THE ORACLE:
APOLLO BE MY IUDGE

   LORD. THIS YOUR REQUEST
IS ALTOGETHER IUST: THEREFORE BRING FORTH
(AND IN APOLLO'S NAME) HIS ORACLE

   HER. THE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA WAS MY FATHER.
OH THAT HE WERE ALIUE, AND HERE BEHOLDING
HIS DAUGHTERS TRYALL: THAT HE DID BUT SEE

OF PITTY, NOT REUENGE

   OFFICER. YOU HERE SHAL SWEARE VPON THIS SWORD OF IUSTICE,
THAT YOU (CLEOMINES AND DION) HAUE

THIS SEAL'D-VP ORACLE, BY THE HAND DELIUER'D
OF GREAT APOLLO'S PRIEST; AND THAT SINCE THEN,
YOU HAUE NOT DAR'D TO BREAKE THE HOLY SEALE,
NOR READ THE SECRETS IN'T

   CLEO. DIO. ALL THIS WE SWEARE

   LEO. BREAKE VP THE SEALES, AND READ

   OFFICER. HERMIONE IS CHAST, POLIXENES BLAMELESSE, CAMILLO
A TRUE SUBIECT, LEONTES A IEALOUS TYRANT, HIS INNOCENT BABE
TRULY BEGOTTEN, AND THE KING SHALL LIUE WITHOUT AN HEIRE, IF THAT
WHICH IS LOST, BE NOT FOUND

   LORDS. NOW BLESSED BE THE GREAT APOLLO

   HER. PRAYSED

   LEO. HAST THOU READ TRUTH?
  OFFIC. I (MY LORD) EUEN SO AS IT IS HERE SET DOWNE

THE SESSIONS SHALL PROCEED: THIS IS MEERE FALSEHOOD

   SER. MY LORD THE KING: THE KING?
  LEO. WHAT IS THE BUSINESSE?
  SER. O SIR, I SHALL BE HATED TO REPORT IT.
THE PRINCE YOUR SONNE, WITH MEERE CONCEIT, AND FEARE
OF THE QUEENES SPEED, IS GONE

   LEO. HOW? GONE?
  SER. IS DEAD

   LEO. APOLLO'S ANGRY, AND THE HEAUENS THEMSELUES
DOE STRIKE AT MY INIUSTICE. HOW NOW THERE?
  PAUL. THIS NEWES IS MORTALL TO THE QUEENE: LOOK DOWNE
AND SEE WHAT DEATH IS DOING

   LEO. TAKE HER HENCE:
HER HEART IS BUT O'RE-CHARG'D: SHE WILL RECOUER.
I HAUE TOO MUCH BELEEU'D MINE OWNE SUSPITION:
'BESEECH YOU TENDERLY APPLY TO HER
SOME REMEDIES FOR LIFE. APOLLO PARDON
MY GREAT PROPHANENESSE 'GAINST THINE ORACLE.
ILE RECONCILE ME TO POLIXENES,
NEW WOE MY QUEENE, RECALL THE GOOD CAMILLO
(WHOM I PROCLAIME A MAN OF TRUTH, OF MERCY:)
FOR BEING TRANSPORTED BY MY IEALOUSIES
TO BLOODY THOUGHTS, AND TO REUENGE, I CHOSE
CAMILLO FOR THE MINISTER, TO POYSON
MY FRIEND POLIXENES: WHICH HAD BEEN DONE,
BUT THAT THE GOOD MIND OF CAMILLO TARDIED
MY SWIFT COMMAND: THOUGH I WITH DEATH, AND WITH
REWARD, DID THREATEN AND ENCOURAGE HIM,
NOT DOING IT, AND BEING DONE: HE (MOST HUMANE,
AND FILL'D WITH HONOR) TO MY KINGLY GUEST
VNCLASP'D MY PRACTISE, QUIT HIS FORTUNES HERE
(WHICH YOU KNEW GREAT) AND TO THE HAZARD
OF ALL INCERTAINTIES, HIMSELFE COMMENDED,
NO RICHER THEN HIS HONOR: HOW HE GLISTERS
THROUGH MY RUST? AND HOW HIS PIETIE
DO'S MY DEEDS MAKE THE BLACKER?
  PAUL. WOE THE WHILE:
O CUT MY LACE, LEAST MY HEART (CRACKING IT)
BREAKE TOO

   LORD. WHAT FIT IS THIS? GOOD LADY?
  PAUL. WHAT STUDIED TORMENTS (TYRANT) HAST FOR ME?
WHAT WHEELES? RACKS? FIRES? WHAT FLAYING? BOYLING?
IN LEADS, OR OYLES? WHAT OLD, OR NEWER TORTURE
MUST I RECEIUE? WHOSE EUERY WORD DESERUES
TO TASTE OF THY MOST WORST. THY TYRANNY
(TOGETHER WORKING WITH THY IEALOUSIES,
FANCIES TOO WEAKE FOR BOYES, TOO GREENE AND IDLE
FOR GIRLES OF NINE) O THINKE WHAT THEY HAUE DONE,
AND THEN RUN MAD INDEED: STARKE-MAD: FOR ALL
THY BY-GONE FOOLERIES WERE BUT SPICES OF IT.
THAT THOU BETRAYED'ST POLIXENES, 'TWAS NOTHING,
(THAT DID BUT SHEW THEE, OF A FOOLE, INCONSTANT,
AND DAMNABLE INGRATEFULL:) NOR WAS'T MUCH.
THOU WOULD'ST HAUE POYSON'D GOOD CAMILLO'S HONOR,
TO HAUE HIM KILL A KING: POORE TRESPASSES,
MORE MONSTROUS STANDING BY: WHEREOF I RECKON
THE CASTING FORTH TO CROWES, THY BABY-DAUGHTER,
TO BE OR NONE, OR LITTLE; THOUGH A DEUILL
WOULD HAUE SHED WATER OUT OF FIRE, ERE DON'T;
NOR IS'T DIRECTLY LAYD TO THEE, THE DEATH
OF THE YOUNG PRINCE, WHOSE HONORABLE THOUGHTS
(THOUGHTS HIGH FOR ONE SO TENDER) CLEFT THE HEART
THAT COULD CONCEIUE A GROSSE AND FOOLISH SIRE
BLEMISH'D HIS GRACIOUS DAM: THIS IS NOT, NO,
LAYD TO THY ANSWERE: BUT THE LAST: O LORDS,
WHEN I HAUE SAID, CRY WOE: THE QUEENE, THE QUEENE,
THE SWEET'ST, DEER'ST CREATURE'S DEAD: & VENGEANCE FOR'T
NOT DROP'D DOWNE YET

   LORD. THE HIGHER POWRES FORBID

   PAU. I SAY SHE'S DEAD: ILE SWEAR'T. IF WORD, NOR OATH
PREUAILE NOT, GO AND SEE: IF YOU CAN BRING
TINCTURE, OR LUSTRE IN HER LIP, HER EYE
HEATE OUTWARDLY, OR BREATH WITHIN, ILE SERUE YOU
AS I WOULD DO THE GODS. BUT, O THOU TYRANT,
DO NOT REPENT THESE THINGS, FOR THEY ARE HEAUIER
THEN ALL THY WOES CAN STIRRE: THEREFORE BETAKE THEE
TO NOTHING BUT DISPAIRE. A THOUSAND KNEES,
TEN THOUSAND YEARES TOGETHER, NAKED, FASTING,
VPON A BARREN MOUNTAINE, AND STILL WINTER
IN STORME PERPETUALL, COULD NOT MOUE THE GODS
TO LOOKE THAT WAY THOU WER'T

   LEO. GO ON, GO ON:
THOU CANST NOT SPEAKE TOO MUCH, I HAUE DESERU'D
ALL TONGUES TO TALKE THEIR BITTREST

   LORD. SAY NO MORE;
HOW ERE THE BUSINESSE GOES, YOU HAUE MADE FAULT
I'TH BOLDNESSE OF YOUR SPEECH

   PAU. I AM SORRY FOR'T;
ALL FAULTS I MAKE, WHEN I SHALL COME TO KNOW THEM,
I DO REPENT: ALAS, I HAUE SHEW'D TOO MUCH
THE RASHNESSE OF A WOMAN: HE IS TOUCHT
TO TH' NOBLE HEART. WHAT'S GONE, AND WHAT'S PAST HELPE
SHOULD BE PAST GREEFE: DO NOT RECEIUE AFFLICTION
AT MY PETITION; I BESEECH YOU, RATHER
LET ME BE PUNISH'D, THAT HAUE MINDED YOU
OF WHAT YOU SHOULD FORGET. NOW (GOOD MY LIEGE)
SIR, ROYALL SIR, FORGIUE A FOOLISH WOMAN:
THE LOUE I BORE YOUR QUEENE (LO, FOOLE AGAINE)
ILE SPEAKE OF HER NO MORE, NOR OF YOUR CHILDREN:
ILE NOT REMEMBER YOU OF MY OWNE LORD,
(WHO IS LOST TOO:) TAKE YOUR PATIENCE TO YOU,
AND ILE SAY NOTHING

   LEO. THOU DIDST SPEAKE BUT WELL,
WHEN MOST THE TRUTH: WHICH I RECEYUE MUCH BETTER,
THEN TO BE PITTIED OF THEE. PRETHEE BRING ME
TO THE DEAD BODIES OF MY QUEENE, AND SONNE,
ONE GRAUE SHALL BE FOR BOTH: VPON THEM SHALL
THE CAUSES OF THEIR DEATH APPEARE (VNTO
OUR SHAME PERPETUALL) ONCE A DAY, ILE VISIT
THE CHAPPELL WHERE THEY LYE, AND TEARES SHED THERE

SO LIKE A WAKING. TO ME COMES A CREATURE,
SOMETIMES HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE, SOME ANOTHER,
I NEUER SAW A VESSELL OF LIKE SORROW
SO FILL'D, AND SO BECOMMING: IN PURE WHITE ROBES
LIKE VERY SANCTITY SHE DID APPROACH
MY CABINE WHERE I LAY: THRICE BOW'D BEFORE ME,
AND (GASPING TO BEGIN SOME SPEECH) HER EYES
BECAME TWO SPOUTS; THE FURIE SPENT, ANON
DID THIS BREAKE FROM HER. GOOD ANTIGONUS,

DOE ALL LYE THERE: IT SHALL BE SO MY CARE,

THE SCENE YOU PLAY, WERE MINE. FOR INSTANCE SIR,
THAT YOU MAY KNOW YOU SHALL NOT WANT: ONE WORD.
ENTER AUTOLICUS.

  AUT. HA, HA, WHAT A FOOLE HONESTIE IS? AND TRUST (HIS
SWORNE BROTHER) A VERY SIMPLE GENTLEMAN. I HAUE SOLD

GLASSE, POMANDER, BROWCH, TABLE-BOOKE, BALLAD, KNIFE,
TAPE, GLOUE, SHOOE-TYE, BRACELET, HORNE-RING, TO KEEPE
MY PACK FROM FASTING: THEY THRONG WHO SHOULD BUY FIRST,
AS IF MY TRINKETS HAD BEENE HALLOWED, AND BROUGHT A BENEDICTION
TO THE BUYER: BY WHICH MEANES, I SAW WHOSE
PURSE WAS BEST IN PICTURE; AND WHAT I SAW, TO MY GOOD
VSE, I REMEMBRED. MY CLOWNE (WHO WANTS BUT SOMETHING
TO BE A REASONABLE MAN) GREW SO IN LOUE WITH THE
WENCHES SONG, THAT HEE WOULD NOT STIRRE HIS PETTY-TOES,
TILL HE HAD BOTH TUNE AND WORDS, WHICH SO DREW THE REST
OF THE HEARD TO ME, THAT ALL THEIR OTHER SENCES STUCKE IN
EARES: YOU MIGHT HAUE PINCH'D A PLACKET, IT WAS SENCELESSE;
'TWAS NOTHING TO GUELD A COD-PEECE OF A PURSE: I
WOULD HAUE FILL'D KEYES OF THAT HUNG IN CHAYNES: NO
HEARING, NO FEELING, BUT MY SIRS SONG, AND ADMIRING THE
NOTHING OF IT. SO THAT IN THIS TIME OF LETHARGIE, I PICKD
AND CUT MOST OF THEIR FESTIUALL PURSES: AND HAD NOT THE
OLD-MAN COME IN WITH A WHOO-BUB AGAINST HIS DAUGHTER,
AND THE KINGS SONNE, AND SCAR'D MY CHOWGHES FROM

ARMY

MAKE AN EXCHANGE; THEREFORE DIS-CASE THEE INSTANTLY (THOU
MUST THINKE THERE'S A NECESSITIE IN'T) AND CHANGE GARMENTS
WITH THIS GENTLEMAN: THOUGH THE PENNY-WORTH (ON HIS

DIS-MANTLE YOU, AND (AS YOU CAN) DISLIKEN
THE TRUTH OF YOUR OWNE SEEMING, THAT YOU MAY

ENTER.

  AUT. I VNDERSTAND THE BUSINESSE, I HEARE IT: TO HAUE AN
OPEN EARE, A QUICK EYE, AND A NIMBLE HAND, IS NECESSARY FOR
A CUT-PURSE; A GOOD NOSE IS REQUISITE ALSO, TO SMELL OUT
WORKE FOR TH' OTHER SENCES. I SEE THIS IS THE TIME THAT THE
VNIUST MAN DOTH THRIUE. WHAT AN EXCHANGE HAD THIS BEEN,
WITHOUT BOOT? WHAT A BOOT IS HERE, WITH THIS EXCHANGE?
SURE THE GODS DOE THIS YEERE CONNIUE AT VS, AND WE MAY
DOE ANY THING EXTEMPORE. THE PRINCE HIMSELFE IS ABOUT
A PEECE OF INIQUITIE (STEALING AWAY FROM HIS FATHER, WITH
HIS CLOG AT HIS HEELES:) IF I THOUGHT IT WERE A PEECE OF HONESTIE
TO ACQUAINT THE KING WITHALL, I WOULD NOT DO'T: I
HOLD IT THE MORE KNAUERIE TO CONCEALE IT; AND THEREIN AM
I CONSTANT TO MY PROFESSION.
ENTER CLOWNE AND SHEPHEARD.

WHERE HEE IS TO BEHOLD HIM, WITH FLYES BLOWN TO DEATH.)
BUT WHAT TALKE WE OF THESE TRAITORLY-RASCALS, WHOSE MISERIES

  CLEO. SIR, YOU HAUE DONE ENOUGH, AND HAUE PERFORM'D
A SAINT-LIKE SORROW: NO FAULT COULD YOU MAKE,
WHICH YOU HAUE NOT REDEEM'D; INDEED PAY'D DOWNE
MORE PENITENCE, THEN DONE TRESPAS: AT THE LAST
DOE, AS THE HEAUENS HAUE DONE; FORGET YOUR EUILL,

FOR HA'S NOT THE DIUINE APOLLO SAID?
IS'T NOT THE TENOR OF HIS ORACLE,
THAT KING LEONTES SHALL NOT HAUE AN HEIRE,

IS ALL AS MONSTROUS TO OUR HUMANE REASON,
AS MY ANTIGONUS TO BREAKE HIS GRAUE,
AND COME AGAINE TO ME: WHO, ON MY LIFE,
DID PERISH WITH THE INFANT. 'TIS YOUR COUNCELL,
MY LORD SHOULD TO THE HEAUENS BE CONTRARY,

SCOENA SECUNDA.


ENTER AUTOLICUS, AND A GENTLEMAN.

  AUT. BESEECH YOU (SIR) WERE YOU PRESENT AT THIS RELATION?
  GENT.1. I WAS BY AT THE OPENING OF THE FARTHELL, HEARD
THE OLD SHEPHEARD DELIUER THE MANNER HOW HE FOUND IT:
WHEREUPON (AFTER A LITTLE AMAZEDNESSE) WE WERE ALL COMMANDED
OUT OF THE CHAMBER: ONELY THIS (ME THOUGHT) I
HEARD THE SHEPHEARD SAY, HE FOUND THE CHILD

   AUT. I WOULD MOST GLADLY KNOW THE ISSUE OF IT

   GENT.1. I MAKE A BROKEN DELIUERIE OF THE BUSINESSE;
BUT THE CHANGES I PERCEIUED IN THE KING, AND CAMILLO, WERE
VERY NOTES OF ADMIRATION: THEY SEEM'D ALMOST, WITH STARING
ON ONE ANOTHER, TO TEARE THE CASES OF THEIR EYES.
THERE WAS SPEECH IN THEIR DUMBNESSE, LANGUAGE IN THEIR
VERY GESTURE: THEY LOOK'D AS THEY HAD HEARD OF A WORLD
RANSOM'D, OR ONE DESTROYED: A NOTABLE PASSION OF WONDER
APPEARED IN THEM: BUT THE WISEST BEHOLDER, THAT KNEW
NO MORE BUT SEEING, COULD NOT SAY, IF TH' IMPORTANCE WERE
IOY, OR SORROW; BUT IN THE EXTREMITIE OF THE ONE, IT MUST
NEEDS BE.
ENTER ANOTHER GENTLEMAN.

HERE COMES A GENTLEMAN, THAT HAPPILY KNOWES MORE:
THE NEWES, ROGERO

   GENT.2. NOTHING BUT BON-FIRES: THE ORACLE IS FULFILL'D:
THE KINGS DAUGHTER IS FOUND: SUCH A DEALE OF WONDER IS
BROKEN OUT WITHIN THIS HOURE, THAT BALLAD-MAKERS CANNOT
BE ABLE TO EXPRESSE IT.
ENTER ANOTHER GENTLEMAN.

HERE COMES THE LADY PAULINA'S STEWARD, HEE CAN DELIUER
YOU MORE. HOW GOES IT NOW (SIR.) THIS NEWES (WHICH
IS CALL'D TRUE) IS SO LIKE AN OLD TALE, THAT THE VERITIE OF IT IS
IN STRONG SUSPITION: HA'S THE KING FOUND HIS HEIRE?
  GENT.3. MOST TRUE, IF EUER TRUTH WERE PREGNANT BY
CIRCUMSTANCE: THAT WHICH YOU HEARE, YOU'LE SWEARE
YOU SEE, THERE IS SUCH VNITIE IN THE PROOFES. THE MANTLE
OF QUEENE HERMIONES: HER IEWELL ABOUT THE NECK OF IT:
THE LETTERS OF ANTIGONUS FOUND WITH IT, WHICH THEY KNOW
TO BE HIS CHARACTER: THE MAIESTIE OF THE CREATURE, IN RESEMBLANCE
OF THE MOTHER: THE AFFECTION OF NOBLENESSE,
WHICH NATURE SHEWES ABOUE HER BREEDING, AND MANY OTHER
EUIDENCES, PROCLAYME HER, WITH ALL CERTAINTIE, TO BE
THE KINGS DAUGHTER. DID YOU SEE THE MEETING OF THE
TWO KINGS?
  GENT.2. NO

   GENT.3. THEN HAUE YOU LOST A SIGHT WHICH WAS TO BEE
SEENE, CANNOT BEE SPOKEN OF. THERE MIGHT YOU HAUE BEHELD
ONE IOY CROWNE ANOTHER, SO AND IN SUCH MANNER, THAT
IT SEEM'D SORROW WEPT TO TAKE LEAUE OF THEM: FOR THEIR
IOY WADED IN TEARES. THERE WAS CASTING VP OF EYES, HOLDING
VP OF HANDS, WITH COUNTENANCE OF SUCH DISTRACTION,
THAT THEY WERE TO BE KNOWNE BY GARMENT, NOT BY FAUOR.
OUR KING BEING READY TO LEAPE OUT OF HIMSELFE, FOR IOY OF
HIS FOUND DAUGHTER; AS IF THAT IOY WERE NOW BECOME A
LOSSE, CRYES, OH, THY MOTHER, THY MOTHER: THEN ASKES
BOHEMIA FORGIUENESSE, THEN EMBRACES HIS SONNE-IN-LAW:
THEN AGAINE WORRYES HE HIS DAUGHTER, WITH CLIPPING HER.
NOW HE THANKS THE OLD SHEPHEARD (WHICH STANDS BY, LIKE
A WEATHER-BITTEN CONDUIT, OF MANY KINGS REIGNES.) I
NEUER HEARD OF SUCH ANOTHER ENCOUNTER; WHICH LAMES REPORT
TO FOLLOW IT, AND VNDO'S DESCRIPTION TO DOE IT

   GENT.2. WHAT, 'PRAY YOU, BECAME OF ANTIGONUS, THAT
CARRYED HENCE THE CHILD?
  GENT.3. LIKE AN OLD TALE STILL, WHICH WILL HAUE MATTER
TO REHEARSE, THOUGH CREDIT BE ASLEEPE, AND NOT AN EARE OPEN;
HE WAS TORNE TO PIECES WITH A BEARE: THIS AUOUCHES
THE SHEPHEARDS SONNE; WHO HA'S NOT ONELY HIS INNOCENCE
(WHICH SEEMES MUCH) TO IUSTIFIE HIM, BUT A HAND-KERCHIEF
AND RINGS OF HIS, THAT PAULINA KNOWES

   GENT.1. WHAT BECAME OF HIS BARKE, AND HIS FOLLOWERS?
  GENT.3. WRACKT THE SAME INSTANT OF THEIR MASTERS
DEATH, AND IN THE VIEW OF THE SHEPHEARD: SO THAT ALL THE
INSTRUMENTS WHICH AYDED TO EXPOSE THE CHILD, WERE EUEN
THEN LOST, WHEN IT WAS FOUND. BUT OH THE NOBLE COMBAT,
THAT 'TWIXT IOY AND SORROW WAS FOUGHT IN PAULINA. SHEE
HAD ONE EYE DECLIN'D FOR THE LOSSE OF HER HUSBAND, ANOTHER
ELEUATED, THAT THE ORACLE WAS FULFILL'D: SHEE LIFTED THE
PRINCESSE FROM THE EARTH, AND SO LOCKS HER IN EMBRACING,
AS IF SHEE WOULD PIN HER TO HER HEART, THAT SHEE MIGHT NO
MORE BE IN DANGER OF LOOSING

   GENT.1. THE DIGNITIE OF THIS ACT WAS WORTH THE AUDIENCE
OF KINGS AND PRINCES, FOR BY SUCH WAS IT ACTED

   GENT.3. ONE OF THE PRETTYEST TOUCHES OF ALL, AND THAT
WHICH ANGL'D FOR MINE EYES (CAUGHT THE WATER, THOUGH
NOT THE FISH) WAS, WHEN AT THE RELATION OF THE QUEENES
DEATH (WITH THE MANNER HOW SHEE CAME TO'T, BRAUELY CONFESS'D,
AND LAMENTED BY THE KING) HOW ATTENTIUENESSE
WOUNDED HIS DAUGHTER, TILL (FROM ONE SIGNE OF DOLOUR TO
ANOTHER) SHEE DID (WITH AN ALAS) I WOULD FAINE SAY, BLEED
TEARES; FOR I AM SURE, MY HEART WEPT BLOOD. WHO WAS
MOST MARBLE, THERE CHANGED COLOUR: SOME SWOWNDED, ALL
SORROWED: IF ALL THE WORLD COULD HAUE SEEN'T, THE WOE
HAD BEENE VNIUERSALL

   GENT.1. ARE THEY RETURNED TO THE COURT?
  GENT.3. NO: THE PRINCESSE HEARING OF HER MOTHERS
STATUE (WHICH IS IN THE KEEPING OF PAULINA) A PEECE MANY
YEERES IN DOING, AND NOW NEWLY PERFORM'D, BY THAT RARE
ITALIAN MASTER, IULIO ROMANO, WHO (HAD HE HIMSELFE ETERNITIE,
AND COULD PUT BREATH INTO HIS WORKE) WOULD BEGUILE
NATURE OF HER CUSTOME, SO PERFECTLY HE IS HER APE:
HE SO NEERE TO HERMIONE, HATH DONE HERMIONE, THAT THEY
SAY ONE WOULD SPEAKE TO HER, AND STAND IN HOPE OF ANSWER.
THITHER (WITH ALL GREEDINESSE OF AFFECTION) ARE THEY GONE,
AND THERE THEY INTEND TO SUP

   GENT.2. I THOUGHT SHE HAD SOME GREAT MATTER THERE IN
HAND, FOR SHEE HATH PRIUATELY, TWICE OR THRICE A DAY, EUER
SINCE THE DEATH OF HERMIONE, VISITED THAT REMOUED HOUSE.
SHALL WEE THITHER, AND WITH OUR COMPANIE PEECE THE REIOYCING?
  GENT.1. WHO WOULD BE THENCE, THAT HA'S THE BENEFIT
OF ACCESSE? EUERY WINKE OF AN EYE, SOME NEW GRACE
WILL BE BORNE: OUR ABSENCE MAKES VS VNTHRIFTIE TO OUR
KNOWLEDGE. LET'S ALONG.
ENTER.

  AUT. NOW (HAD I NOT THE DASH OF MY FORMER LIFE IN
ME) WOULD PREFERMENT DROP ON MY HEAD. I BROUGHT THE
OLD MAN AND HIS SONNE ABOORD THE PRINCE; TOLD HIM, I
HEARD THEM TALKE OF A FARTHELL, AND I KNOW NOT WHAT: BUT
HE AT THAT TIME OUER-FOND OF THE SHEPHEARDS DAUGHTER (SO
HE THEN TOOKE HER TO BE) WHO BEGAN TO BE MUCH SEA-SICK,
AND HIMSELFE LITTLE BETTER, EXTREMITIE OF WEATHER CONTINUING,
THIS MYSTERIE REMAINED VNDISCOUER'D. BUT 'TIS ALL
ONE TO ME: FOR HAD I BEENE THE FINDER-OUT OF THIS SECRET,
IT WOULD NOT HAUE RELLISH'D AMONG MY OTHER DISCREDITS.
ENTER SHEPHEARD AND CLOWNE.

HERE COME THOSE I HAUE DONE GOOD TO AGAINST MY WILL,
AND ALREADIE APPEARING IN THE BLOSSOMES OF THEIR FORTUNE

   SHEP. COME BOY, I AM PAST MOE CHILDREN: BUT THY
SONNES AND DAUGHTERS WILL BE ALL GENTLEMEN BORNE

   CLOW. YOU ARE WELL MET (SIR:) YOU DENY'D TO FIGHT
WITH MEE THIS OTHER DAY, BECAUSE I WAS NO GENTLEMAN
BORNE. SEE YOU THESE CLOTHES? SAY YOU SEE THEM NOT,
AND THINKE ME STILL NO GENTLEMAN BORNE: YOU WERE BEST
SAY THESE ROBES ARE NOT GENTLEMEN BORNE. GIUE ME THE
LYE: DOE: AND TRY WHETHER I AM NOT NOW A GENTLEMAN
BORNE

AND THE PRINCESSE (MY SISTER) CALL'D MY FATHER, FATHER;
AND SO WEE WEPT: AND THERE WAS THE FIRST GENTLEMAN-LIKE
TEARES THAT EUER WE SHED

   SHEP. WE MAY LIUE (SONNE) TO SHED MANY MORE

   CLOW. I: OR ELSE 'TWERE HARD LUCK, BEING IN SO PREPOSTEROUS
ESTATE AS WE ARE

   AUT. I HUMBLY BESEECH YOU (SIR) TO PARDON ME ALL THE
FAULTS I HAUE COMMITTED TO YOUR WORSHIP, AND TO GIUE

   SHEP. 'PRETHEE SONNE DOE: FOR WE MUST BE GENTLE, NOW

   CLOW. THOU WILT AMEND THY LIFE?
  AUT. I, AND IT LIKE YOUR GOOD WORSHIP

   CLOW. GIUE ME THY HAND: I WILL SWEARE TO THE PRINCE,
THOU ART AS HONEST A TRUE FELLOW AS ANY IS IN BOHEMIA

   SHEP. YOU MAY SAY IT, BUT NOT SWEARE IT

   CLOW. NOT SWEARE IT, NOW I AM A GENTLEMAN? LET
BOORES AND FRANCKLINS SAY IT, ILE SWEARE IT

   SHEP. HOW IF IT BE FALSE (SONNE?)
  CLOW. IF IT BE NE'RE SO FALSE, A TRUE GENTLEMAN MAY
SWEARE IT, IN THE BEHALFE OF HIS FRIEND: AND ILE SWEARE TO
THE PRINCE, THOU ART A TALL FELLOW OF THY HANDS, AND THAT
THOU WILT NOT BE DRUNKE: BUT I KNOW THOU ART NO TALL FELLOW
OF THY HANDS, AND THAT THOU WILT BE DRUNKE: BUT ILE
SWEARE IT, AND I WOULD THOU WOULD'ST BE A TALL FELLOW OF
THY HANDS

   AUT. I WILL PROUE SO (SIR) TO MY POWER

   CLOW. I, BY ANY MEANES PROUE A TALL FELLOW: IF I DO NOT
WONDER, HOW THOU DAR'ST VENTURE TO BE DRUNKE, NOT BEING

LAMENT, TILL I AM LOST

   LEO. O PEACE PAULINA:
THOU SHOULDST A HUSBAND TAKE BY MY CONSENT,

AND MADE BETWEENE'S BY VOWES. THOU HAST FOUND MINE,

A PRAYER VPON HER GRAUE. ILE NOT SEEKE FARRE

AN HONOURABLE HUSBAND. COME CAMILLO,
AND TAKE HER BY THE HAND: WHOSE WORTH, AND HONESTY

BY VS, A PAIRE OF KINGS. LET'S FROM THIS PLACE.
WHAT? LOOKE VPON MY BROTHER: BOTH YOUR PARDONS,
