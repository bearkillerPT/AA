actus primus scoena prima

enter camillo and archidamus

arch if you shall chance camillo to visit bohemia on
the like occasion whereon my seruices are now
on-foot you shall see as i haue said great difference
betwixt our bohemia and your sicilia

cam i thinke this comming summer the king of
sicilia meanes to pay bohemia the visitation which hee
iustly owes him

arch wherein our entertainment shall shame vs we
will be iustified in our loues for indeed-
cam 'beseech you-
arch verely i speake it in the freedome of my knowledge
we can not with such magnificence- in so rare-
i know not what to say- wee will giue you sleepie
drinkes that your sences vn-intelligent of our insufficience
may though they can not prayse vs as little accuse
vs

cam you pay a great deale to deare for what 's giuen
freely

arch 'beleeue me i speake as my vnderstanding instructs
me and as mine honestie puts it to vtterance

cam sicilia can not shew himselfe ouer-kind to bohemia
they were trayn 'd together in their childhoods
and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection
which can not chuse but braunch now since their more
mature dignities and royall necessities made seperation
of their societie their encounters though not personall
hath been royally attornyed with enter-change of
gifts letters louing embassies that they haue seem 'd to
be together though absent shooke hands as ouer a vast
and embrac 'd as it were from the ends of opposed winds
the heauens continue their loues

arch i thinke there is not in the world either malice
or matter to alter it you haue an vnspeakable comfort
of your young prince mamillius it is a gentleman of the
greatest promise that euer came into my note

cam i very well agree with you in the hopes of him
it is a gallant child one that indeed physicks the subiect
makes old hearts fresh they that went on crutches
ere he was borne desire yet their life to see him a man

arch would they else be content to die
cam yes if there were no other excuse why they should
desire to liue

arch if the king had no sonne they would desire to
liue on crutches till he had one

pol presse me not 'beseech you so
there is no tongue that moues none none i'th world
so soone as yours could win me so it should now
were there necessitie in your request although

you had drawne oathes from him not to stay you sir
charge him too coldly tell him you are sure

he 's beat from his best ward

leo well said hermione

but let him say so then and let him goe
but let him sweare so and he shall not stay
wee l thwack him hence with distaffes
yet of your royall presence ile aduenture
the borrow of a weeke when at bohemia

of my lords tricks and yours when you were boyes
you were pretty lordings then
pol we were faire queene
two lads that thought there was no more behind

the veryer wag o'th two
pol we were as twyn 'd lambs that did frisk i'th sun
and bleat the one at th other what we chang 'd
was innocence for innocence we knew not
the doctrine of ill-doing nor dream 'd
that any did had we pursu 'd that life
and our weake spirits ne 're been higher rear 'd
with stronger blood we should haue answer 'd heauen
boldly not guilty the imposition clear 'd
hereditarie ours

her by this we gather
you haue tript since

pol o my most sacred lady
temptations haue since then been borne to 's for
in those vnfledg 'd dayes was my wife a girle

my last good deed was to entreat his stay
what was my first it ha 's an elder sister
or i mistake you o would her name were grace
but once before i spoke to th purpose when
nay let me haue't i long

leo why that was when
three crabbed moneths had sowr 'd themselues to death
ere i could make thee open thy white hand
a clap thy selfe my loue then didst thou vtter
i am yours for euer

her 't is grace indeed
why lo-you now i haue spoke to th purpose twice
the one for euer earn 'd a royall husband
th other for some while a friend

leo too hot too hot
to mingle friendship farre is mingling bloods
i haue tremor cordis on me my heart daunces
but not for ioy not ioy this entertainment
may a free face put on deriue a libertie
from heartinesse from bountie fertile bosome
and well become the agent 't may i graunt
but to be padling palmes and pinching fingers
as now they are and making practis 'd smiles
as in a looking-glasse and then to sigh as 'twere
the mort o'th deere oh that is entertainment

leo thou want'st a rough pash the shoots that i haue
to be full like me yet they say we are
almost as like as egges women say so
that will say any thing but were they false
as o're-dy 'd blacks as wind as waters false
as dice are to be wish 'd by one that fixes
no borne 'twixt his and mine yet were it true
to say this boy were like me come sir page
looke on me with your welkin eye sweet villaine
most dear'st my collop can thy dam may't be
affection thy intention stabs the center
thou do'st make possible things not so held
communicat'st with dreames how can this be
with what 's vnreall thou coactiue art

thou may'st co-ioyne with something and thou do'st
and that beyond commission and i find it

and hardning of my browes
pol what meanes sicilia

pol how my lord
leo what cheere how is't with you best brother
her you look as if you held a brow of much distraction
are you mou 'd my lord
leo no in good earnest
how sometimes nature will betray it 's folly
it 's tendernesse and make it selfe a pastime
to harder bosomes looking on the lynes
of my boyes face me thoughts i did requoyle
twentie three yeeres and saw my selfe vn-breech 'd
in my greene veluet coat my dagger muzzel 'd

and leaue you to your grauer steps hermione
how thou lou'st vs shew in our brothers welcome
let what is deare in sicily be cheape

apparant to my heart

her if you would seeke vs
we are yours i'th garden shall 's attend you there
leo to your owne bents dispose you you'le be found
be you beneath the sky i am angling now
though you perceiue me not how i giue lyne
goe too goe too
how she holds vp the neb the byll to him
and armes her with the boldnesse of a wife
to her allowing husband gone already
ynch-thick knee-deepe ore head and eares a fork 'd one
goe play boy play thy mother playes and i
play too but so disgrac 'd a part whose issue
will hisse me to my graue contempt and clamor
will be my knell goe play boy play there haue been
or i am much deceiu 'd cuckolds ere now
and many a man there is euen at this present
now while i speake this holds his wife by th arme
that little thinkes she ha 's been sluyc 'd in 's absence
and his pond fish 'd by his next neighbor by
sir smile his neighbor nay there 's comfort i n't
whiles other men haue gates and those gates open 'd
as mine against their will should all despaire
that haue reuolted wiues the tenth of mankind
would hang themselues physick for't there 's none
it is a bawdy planet that will strike
where 't is predominant and 't is powrefull thinke it
from east west north and south be it concluded
no barricado for a belly know't
it will let in and out the enemy
with bag and baggage many thousand on 's
haue the disease and feele't not how now boy
mam i am like you say

leo why that 's some comfort
what camillo there
cam i my good lord

leo goe play mamillius thou'rt an honest man
camillo this great sir will yet stay longer

cam you had much adoe to make his anchor hold
when you cast out it still came home

leo didst note it
cam he would not stay at your petitions made
his businesse more materiall

leo didst perceiue it
they 're here with me already whisp'ring rounding
sicilia is a so-forth 't is farre gone
when i shall gust it last how cam't camillo
that he did stay
cam at the good queenes entreatie

leo at the queenes be't good should be pertinent
but so it is it is not was this taken
by any vnderstanding pate but thine
for thy conceit is soaking will draw in
more then the common blocks not noted is't
but of the finer natures by some seueralls
of head-peece extraordinarie lower messes
perchance are to this businesse purblind say

cam businesse my lord i thinke most vnderstand
bohemia stayes here longer

leo ha
cam stayes here longer

leo i but why
cam to satisfie your highnesse and the entreaties
of our most gracious mistresse

leo satisfie
th entreaties of your mistresse satisfie
let that suffice i haue trusted thee camillo
with all the neerest things to my heart as well
my chamber-councels wherein priest-like thou
hast cleans 'd my bosome i from thee departed
thy penitent reform 'd but we haue been
deceiu 'd in thy integritie deceiu 'd
in that which seemes so

cam be it forbid my lord
leo to bide vpo n't thou art not honest or
if thou inclin'st that way thou art a coward
which hoxes honestie behind restrayning
from course requir 'd or else thou must be counted
a seruant grafted in my serious trust
and therein negligent or else a foole
that seest a game play 'd home the rich stake drawne
and tak'st it all for ieast

cam my gracious lord
i may be negligent foolish and fearefull
in euery one of these no man is free
but that his negligence his folly feare
among the infinite doings of the world
sometime puts forth in your affaires my lord
if euer i were wilfull-negligent
it was my folly if industriously
i play 'd the foole it was my negligence
not weighing well the end if euer fearefull
to doe a thing where i the issue doubted
whereof the execution did cry out
against the non-performance 't was a feare
which oft infects the wisest these my lord
are such allow 'd infirmities that honestie
is neuer free of but beseech your grace
be plainer with me let me know my trespas
by it 's owne visage if i then deny it
't is none of mine

leo ha not you seene camillo
but that 's past doubt you haue or your eye-glasse
is thicker then a cuckolds horne or heard
for to a vision so apparant rumor
can not be mute or thought for cogitation
resides not in that man that do 's not thinke
my wife is slipperie if thou wilt confesse
or else be impudently negatiue
to haue nor eyes nor eares nor thought then say
my wife 's a holy-horse deserues a name
as ranke as any flax-wench that puts to
before her troth-plight say't and iustify't

cam i would not be a stander-by to heare
my soueraigne mistresse clouded so without
my present vengeance taken 'shrew my heart
you neuer spoke what did become you lesse
then this which to reiterate were sin
as deepe as that though true

leo is whispering nothing
is leaning cheeke to cheeke is meating noses
kissing with in-side lip stopping the cariere
of laughter with a sigh a note infallible
of breaking honestie horsing foot on foot
skulking in corners wishing clocks more swift
houres minutes noone mid-night and all eyes
blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs onely
that would vnseene be wicked is this nothing
why then the world and all that 's i n't is nothing
the couering skie is nothing bohemia nothing
my wife is nothing nor nothing haue these nothings
if this be nothing

cam good my lord be cur 'd
of this diseas 'd opinion and betimes
for 't is most dangerous

leo say it be 't is true

cam no no my lord

leo it is you lye you lye
i say thou lyest camillo and i hate thee
pronounce thee a grosse lowt a mindlesse slaue
or else a houering temporizer that
canst with thine eyes at once see good and euill
inclining to them both were my wiues liuer
infected as her life she would not liue
the running of one glasse

cam who do 's infect her
leo why he that weares her like her medull hanging
about his neck bohemia who if i
had seruants true about me that bare eyes
to see alike mine honor as their profits
their owne particular thrifts they would doe that
which should vndoe more doing i and thou
his cup-bearer whom i from meaner forme
haue bench 'd and rear 'd to worship who may'st see
plainely as heauen sees earth and earth sees heauen
how i am gall 'd might'st be-spice a cup
to giue mine enemy a lasting winke
which draught to me were cordiall

cam sir my lord
i could doe this and that with no rash potion
but with a lingring dram that should not worke
maliciously like poyson but i can not
beleeue this crack to be in my dread mistresse
so soueraignely being honorable
i haue lou 'd thee
leo make that thy question and goe rot
do'st thinke i am so muddy so vnsetled
to appoint my selfe in this vexation
sully the puritie and whitenesse of my sheetes
which to preserue is sleepe which being spotted
is goades thornes nettles tayles of waspes
giue scandall to the blood o'th prince my sonne
who i doe thinke is mine and loue as mine
without ripe mouing to't would i doe this
could man so blench
cam i must beleeue you sir
i doe and will fetch off bohemia for't
prouided that when hee 's remou 'd your highnesse
will take againe your queene as yours at first
euen for your sonnes sake and thereby for sealing
the iniurie of tongues in courts and kingdomes
knowne and ally 'd to yours

leo thou do'st aduise me
euen so as i mine owne course haue set downe
ile giue no blemish to her honor none

cam my lord
goe then and with a countenance as cleare
as friendship weares at feasts keepe with bohemia
and with your queene i am his cup-bearer
if from me he haue wholesome beueridge
account me not your seruant

leo this is all
do't and thou hast the one halfe of my heart
do't not thou splitt'st thine owne

cam ile do't my lord

leo i wil seeme friendly as thou hast aduis 'd me

exit

cam o miserable lady but for me
what case stand i in i must be the poysoner
of good polixenes and my ground to do't
is the obedience to a master one
who in rebellion with himselfe will haue
all that are his so too to doe this deed
promotion followes if i could find example
of thousand 's that had struck anoynted kings
and flourish 'd after il 'd not do't but since
nor brasse nor stone nor parchment beares not one
let villanie it selfe forswear't i must
forsake the court to do't or no is certaine
to me a breake-neck happy starre raigne now
here comes bohemia
enter polixenes

pol this is strange me thinkes
my fauor here begins to warpe not speake
good day camillo

cam hayle most royall sir

pol what is the newes i'th court
cam none rare my lord
pol the king hath on him such a countenance
as he had lost some prouince and a region
lou 'd as he loues himselfe euen now i met him
with customarie complement when hee
wafting his eyes to th contrary and falling
a lippe of much contempt speedes from me and
so leaues me to consider what is breeding
that changes thus his manners

cam i dare not know my lord
pol how dare not doe not doe you know and dare not
be intelligent to me 't is thereabouts
for to your selfe what you doe know you must
and can not say you dare not good camillo
your chang 'd complexions are to me a mirror
which shewes me mine chang 'd too for i must be
a partie in this alteration finding
my selfe thus alter 'd with't

cam there is a sicknesse
which puts some of vs in distemper but
i can not name the disease and it is caught
of you that yet are well

pol how caught of me
make me not sighted like the basilisque
i haue look 'd on thousands who haue sped the better
by my regard but kill 'd none so camillo
as you are certainely a gentleman thereto
clerke-like experienc 'd which no lesse adornes
our gentry then our parents noble names
in whose successe we are gentle i beseech you
if you know ought which do 's behoue my knowledge
thereof to be inform 'd impriso n't not
in ignorant concealement

cam i may not answere

pol a sicknesse caught of me and yet i well
i must be answer 'd do'st thou heare camillo
i coniure thee by all the parts of man
which honor do 's acknowledge whereof the least
is not this suit of mine that thou declare
what incidencie thou do'st ghesse of harme
is creeping toward me how farre off how neere
which way to be preuented if to be
if not how best to beare it

cam sir i will tell you
since i am charg 'd in honor and by him
that i thinke honorable therefore marke my counsaile
which must be eu'n as swiftly followed as
i meane to vtter it or both your selfe and me
cry lost and so good night

pol on good camillo

cam i am appointed him to murther you

pol by whom camillo
cam by the king

pol for what
cam he thinkes nay with all confidence he sweares
as he had see n't or beene an instrument
to vice you to't that you haue toucht his queene
forbiddenly

pol oh then my best blood turne
to an infected gelly and my name
be yoak 'd with his that did betray the best
turne then my freshest reputation to
a sauour that may strike the dullest nosthrill
where i arriue and my approch be shun 'd
nay hated too worse then the great'st infection
that ere was heard or read

cam sweare his thought ouer
by each particular starre in heauen and
by all their influences you may as well
forbid the sea for to obey the moone
as or by oath remoue or counsaile shake
the fabrick of his folly whose foundation
is pyl 'd vpon his faith and will continue
the standing of his body

pol how should this grow
cam i know not but i am sure 't is safer to
auoid what 's growne then question how 't is borne
if therefore you dare trust my honestie
that lyes enclosed in this trunke which you
shall beare along impawnd away to night
your followers i will whisper to the businesse
and will by twoes and threes at seuerall posternes
cleare them o'th citie for my selfe ile put
my fortunes to your seruice which are here
by this discouerie lost be not vncertaine
for by the honor of my parents i
haue vttred truth which if you seeke to proue
i dare not stand by nor shall you be safer
then one condemnd by the kings owne mouth
thereon his execution sworne

pol i doe beleeue thee
i saw his heart in 's face giue me thy hand
be pilot to me and thy places shall
still neighbour mine my ships are ready and
my people did expect my hence departure
two dayes agoe this iealousie
is for a precious creature as shee 's rare
must it be great and as his person 's mightie
must it be violent and as he do 's conceiue
he is dishonor 'd by a man which euer
profess 'd to him why his reuenges must
in that be made more bitter feare ore-shades me
good expedition be my friend and comfort
the gracious queene part of his theame but nothing
of his ill-ta'ne suspition come camillo
i will respect thee as a father if
thou bear'st my life off hence let vs auoid

cam it is in mine authoritie to command
the keyes of all the posternes please your highnesse
to take the vrgent houre come sir away

mam you'le kisse me hard and speake to me as if
i were a baby still i loue you better

2.lady and why so my lord
mam not for because
your browes are blacker yet black-browes they say
become some women best so that there be not
too much haire there but in a cemicircle
or a halfe-moone made with a pen
2.lady who taught 'this
mam i learn 'd it out of womens faces pray now
what colour are your eye-browes
lady blew my lord
mam nay that 's a mock i haue seene a ladies nose
that ha 's beene blew but not her eye-browes

lady harke ye

present our seruices to a fine new prince
one of these dayes and then youl 'd wanton with vs
if we would haue you

2.lady she is spread of late

mam merry or sad shal't be

mam a sad tale 's best for winter
i haue one of sprights and goblins

her let 's haue that good sir
come-on sit downe come-on and doe your best
to fright me with your sprights you 're powrefull at it

mam there was a man

her nay come sit downe then on

mam dwelt by a church-yard i will tell it softly
yond crickets shall not heare it

her come on then and giu't me in mine eare

leon was hee met there his traine camillo with
him
lord behind the tuft of pines i met them neuer
saw i men scowre so on their way i eyed them
euen to their ships

leo how blest am i
in my iust censure in my true opinion
alack for lesser knowledge how accurs 'd
in being so blest there may be in the cup
a spider steep 'd and one may drinke depart
and yet partake no venome for his knowledge
is not infected but if one present
th abhor 'd ingredient to his eye make knowne
how he hath drunke he cracks his gorge his sides
with violent hefts i haue drunke and seene the spider
camillo was his helpe in this his pandar
there is a plot against my life my crowne
all 's true that is mistrusted that false villaine
whom i employ 'd was pre-employ 'd by him
he ha 's discouer 'd my designe and i
remaine a pinch 'd thing yea a very trick
for them to play at will how came the posternes
so easily open
lord by his great authority
which often hath no lesse preuail 'd then so
on your command

leo i know't too well
giue me the boy i am glad you did not nurse him
though he do 's beare some signes of me yet you
haue too much blood in him

her what is this sport
leo beare the boy hence he shall not come about her
away with him and let her sport her selfe
with that shee 's big-with for 't is polixenes
ha 's made thee swell thus

her but il 'd say he had not
and ile be sworne you would beleeue my saying
how e 're you leane to th nay-ward

leo you my lords
looke on her marke her well be but about
to say she is a goodly lady and
the iustice of your hearts will thereto adde
't is pitty shee 's not honest honorable
prayse her but for this her without-dore-forme
which on my faith deserues high speech and straight
the shrug the hum or ha these petty-brands
that calumnie doth vse oh i am out
that mercy do 's for calumnie will seare
vertue it selfe these shrugs these hum 's and ha 's
when you haue said shee 's goodly come betweene
ere you can say shee 's honest but be't knowne
from him that ha 's most cause to grieue it should be
shee 's an adultresse

her should a villaine say so
the most replenish 'd villaine in the world
he were as much more villaine you my lord
doe but mistake

leo you haue mistooke my lady
polixenes for leontes o thou thing
which ile not call a creature of thy place
least barbarisme making me the precedent
should a like language vse to all degrees
and mannerly distinguishment leaue out
betwixt the prince and begger i haue said
shee 's an adultresse i haue said with whom
more shee 's a traytor and camillo is
a federarie with her and one that knowes
what she should shame to know her selfe
but with her most vild principall that shee 's
a bed-swaruer euen as bad as those
that vulgars giue bold'st titles i and priuy
to this their late escape

her no by my life
priuy to none of this how will this grieue you
when you shall come to clearer knowledge that
you thus haue publish 'd me gentle my lord
you scarce can right me throughly then to say
you did mistake

leo no if i mistake
in those foundations which i build vpon
the centre is not bigge enough to beare
a schoole-boyes top away with her to prison
he who shall speake for her is a farre-off guiltie
but that he speakes

her there 's some ill planet raignes
i must be patient till the heauens looke

leo reade the indictment

officer hermione queene to the worthy leontes king
of sicilia thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason
in committing adultery with polixenes king of bohemia
and conspiring with camillo to take away the life of our
soueraigne
lord the king thy royall husband the pretence whereof
being by circumstances partly layd open thou hermione contrary
to the faith and allegeance of a true subiect didst counsaile
and ayde them for their better safetie to flye away by
night

her since what i am to say must be but that
which contradicts my accusation and
the testimonie on my part no other
but what comes from my selfe it shall scarce boot me
to say not guiltie mine integritie
being counted falsehood shall as i expresse it
be so receiu 'd but thus if powres diuine
behold our humane actions as they doe
i doubt not then but innocence shall make
false accusation blush and tyrannie
tremble at patience you my lord best know
whom least will seeme to doe so my past life
hath beene as continent as chaste as true
as i am now vnhappy which is more
then historie can patterne though deuis 'd
and play 'd to take spectators for behold me

the mother to a hopefull prince here standing
to prate and talke for life and honor fore
who please to come and heare for life i prize it
as i weigh griefe which i would spare for honor
't is a deriuatiue from me to mine

that any of these bolder vices wanted
lesse impudence to gaine-say what they did

her that 's true enough
though 't is a saying sir not due to me

leo you will not owne it

her more then mistresse of
which comes to me in name of fault i must not
at all acknowledge for polixenes
with whom i am accus 'd i doe confesse
i lou 'd him as in honor he requir 'd
with such a kind of loue as might become
a lady like me with a loue euen such
so and no other as your selfe commanded
which not to haue done i thinke had been in me
both disobedience and ingratitude
to you and toward your friend whose loue had spoke
euen since it could speake from an infant freely
that it was yours now for conspiracie
i know not how it tastes though it be dish 'd
for me to try how all i know of it
is that camillo was an honest man
and why he left your court the gods themselues
wotting no more then i are ignorant

leo you knew of his departure as you know
what you haue vnderta'ne to doe in 's absence

her sir
you speake a language that i vnderstand not
my life stands in the leuell of your dreames
which ile lay downe

leo your actions are my dreames
you had a bastard by polixenes
and i but dream 'd it as you were past all shame
those of your fact are so so past all truth
which to deny concernes more then auailes for as
thy brat hath been cast out like to it selfe
no father owning it which is indeed
more criminall in thee then it so thou
shalt feele our iustice in whose easiest passage
looke for no lesse then death

her sir spare your threats
the bugge which you would fright me with i seeke
to me can life be no commoditie
the crowne and comfort of my life your fauor
i doe giue lost for i doe feele it gone
but know not how it went my second ioy
and first fruits of my body from his presence
i am bar 'd like one infectious my third comfort
star 'd most vnluckily is from my breast
the innocent milke in it most innocent mouth

to women of all fashion lastly hurried
here to this place i'th open ayre before
i haue got strength of limit now my liege
tell me what blessings i haue here aliue
that i should feare to die therefore proceed
but yet heare this mistake me not no life
i prize it not a straw but for mine honor
which i would free if i shall be condemn 'd
vpon surmizes all proofes sleeping else
but what your iealousies awake i tell you
't is rigor and not law your honors all
i doe referre me to the oracle
apollo be my iudge

lord this your request
is altogether iust therefore bring forth
and in apollo 's name his oracle

her the emperor of russia was my father
oh that he were aliue and here beholding
his daughters tryall that he did but see
the flatnesse of my miserie yet with eyes
of pitty not reuenge

officer you here shal sweare vpon this sword of iustice
that you cleomines and dion haue
been both at delphos and from thence haue brought
this seal'd-vp oracle by the hand deliuer 'd
of great apollo 's priest and that since then
you haue not dar 'd to breake the holy seale
nor read the secrets i n't

cleo dio all this we sweare

leo breake vp the seales and read

officer hermione is chast polixenes blamelesse camillo
a true subiect leontes a iealous tyrant his innocent babe
truly begotten and the king shall liue without an heire if that
which is lost be not found

her heart is but o're-charg 'd she will recouer
i haue too much beleeu 'd mine owne suspition
'beseech you tenderly apply to her
some remedies for life apollo pardon
my great prophanenesse 'gainst thine oracle
ile reconcile me to polixenes
new woe my queene recall the good camillo
whom i proclaime a man of truth of mercy
for being transported by my iealousies
to bloody thoughts and to reuenge i chose
camillo for the minister to poyson
my friend polixenes which had been done
but that the good mind of camillo tardied
my swift command though i with death and with
reward did threaten and encourage him
not doing it and being done he most humane
and fill 'd with honor to my kingly guest
vnclasp 'd my practise quit his fortunes here
which you knew great and to the hazard
of all incertainties himselfe commended
no richer then his honor how he glisters

do 's my deeds make the blacker
paul woe the while
o cut my lace least my heart cracking it

paul what studied torments tyrant hast for me
what wheeles racks fires what flaying boyling
in leads or oyles what old or newer torture
must i receiue whose euery word deserues
to taste of thy most worst thy tyranny
together working with thy iealousies
fancies too weake for boyes too greene and idle
for girles of nine o thinke what they haue done
and then run mad indeed starke-mad for all
thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it
that thou betrayed'st polixenes 't was nothing
that did but shew thee of a foole inconstant
and damnable ingratefull nor was't much
thou would'st haue poyson 'd good camillo 's honor
to haue him kill a king poore trespasses
more monstrous standing by whereof i reckon
the casting forth to crowes thy baby-daughter
to be or none or little though a deuill
would haue shed water out of fire ere do n't
nor is't directly layd to thee the death
of the young prince whose honorable thoughts
thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart
that could conceiue a grosse and foolish sire
blemish 'd his gracious dam this is not no
layd to thy answere but the last o lords
when i haue said cry woe the queene the queene
the sweet'st deer'st creature 's dead vengeance for't
not drop 'd downe yet

lord the higher powres forbid

pau i say she 's dead ile swear't if word nor oath
preuaile not go and see if you can bring
tincture or lustre in her lip her eye
heate outwardly or breath within ile serue you
as i would do the gods but o thou tyrant
do not repent these things for they are heauier
then all thy woes can stirre therefore betake thee
to nothing but dispaire a thousand knees
ten thousand yeares together naked fasting
vpon a barren mountaine and still winter
in storme perpetuall could not moue the gods
to looke that way thou wer't

leo go on go on
thou canst not speake too much i haue deseru 'd
all tongues to talke their bittrest

lord say no more
how ere the businesse goes you haue made fault
i'th boldnesse of your speech

pau i am sorry for't
all faults i make when i shall come to know them
i do repent alas i haue shew 'd too much
the rashnesse of a woman he is toucht
to th noble heart what 's gone and what 's past helpe
should be past greefe do not receiue affliction
at my petition i beseech you rather
let me be punish 'd that haue minded you
of what you should forget now good my liege
sir royall sir forgiue a foolish woman
the loue i bore your queene lo foole againe
ile speake of her no more nor of your children
ile not remember you of my owne lord
who is lost too take your patience to you
and ile say nothing

leo thou didst speake but well
when most the truth which i receyue much better
then to be pittied of thee prethee bring me
to the dead bodies of my queene and sonne
one graue shall be for both vpon them shall
the causes of their death appeare vnto
our shame perpetuall once a day ile visit
the chappell where they lye and teares shed there

like very sanctity she did approach
my cabine where i lay thrice bow 'd before me
and gasping to begin some speech her eyes
became two spouts the furie spent anon
did this breake from her good antigonus
since fate against thy better disposition
hath made thy person for the thrower-out

there weepe and leaue it crying and for the babe
is counted lost for euer perdita

to lay my bones there besides the penitent king
my master hath sent for me to whose feeling sorrowes
i might be some allay or i oreweene to thinke so which
is another spurre to my departure

pol as thou lou'st me camillo wipe not out the rest
of thy seruices by leauing me now the neede i haue of
thee thine owne goodnesse hath made better not to
haue had thee then thus to want thee thou hauing made
me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently
manage must either stay to execute them thy selfe
or take away with thee the very seruices thou hast done
which if i haue not enough considered as too much i
can not to bee more thankefull to thee shall bee my studie
and my profite therein the heaping friendshippes
of that fatall countrey sicillia prethee speake no more
whose very naming punnishes me with the remembrance
of that penitent as thou calst him and reconciled king
my brother whose losse of his most precious queene
children are euen now to be a-fresh lamented say to
me when saw'st thou the prince florizell my son kings
are no lesse vnhappy their issue not being gracious then
they are in loosing them when they haue approued their
vertues

cam sir it is three dayes since i saw the prince what
his happier affayres may be are to me vnknowne but i
haue missingly noted he is of late much retyred from
court and is lesse frequent to his princely exercises then
formerly he hath appeared

pol i haue considered so much camillo and with
some care so farre that i haue eyes vnder my seruice
which looke vpon his remouednesse from whom i haue
this intelligence that he is seldome from the house of a
most homely shepheard a man they say that from very
nothing and beyond the imagination of his neighbors
is growne into an vnspeakable estate

cam i haue heard sir of such a man who hath a
daughter of most rare note the report of her is extended
more then can be thought to begin from such a cottage
pol that 's likewise part of my intelligence but i
feare the angle that pluckes our sonne thither thou
shalt accompany vs to the place where we will not appearing
what we are haue some question with the shepheard
from whose simplicity i thinke it not vneasie to
get the cause of my sonnes resort thether 'prethe be my
present partner in this busines and lay aside the thoughts
of sicillia

cam i willingly obey your command

should passe this way as you did oh the fates
how would he looke to see his worke so noble
vildely bound vp what would he say or how
should i in these my borrowed flaunts behold
the sternnesse of his presence
flo apprehend
nothing but iollity the goddes themselues
humbling their deities to loue haue taken
the shapes of beasts vpon them iupiter
became a bull and bellow 'd the greene neptune
a ram and bleated and the fire-roab'd-god
golden apollo a poore humble swaine

were neuer for a peece of beauty rarer
nor in a way so chaste since my desires
run not before mine honor nor my lusts
burne hotter then my faith

perd o but sir
your resolution can not hold when 't is
oppos 'd as it must be by th powre of the king
one of these two must be necessities

with flowres of winter

perd sir the yeare growing ancient
not yet on summers death nor on the birth
of trembling winter the fayrest flowres o'th season
are our carnations and streak 'd gilly-vors
which some call natures bastards of that kind
our rusticke gardens barren and i care not
to get slips of them

pol wherefore gentle maiden
do you neglect them

perd for i haue heard it said
there is an art which in their pidenesse shares
with great creating-nature

pol say there be
yet nature is made better by no meane
but nature makes that meane so ouer that art
which you say addes to nature is an art
that nature makes you see sweet maid we marry
a gentler sien to the wildest stocke
and make conceyue a barke of baser kinde
by bud of nobler race this is an art
which do 's mend nature change it rather but
the art it selfe is nature

perd so it is

your heart is full of something that do 's take
your minde from feasting sooth when i was yong
and handed loue as you do i was wont
to load my shee with knackes i would haue ransackt
the pedlers silken treasury and haue powr 'd it
to her acceptance you haue let him go
and nothing marted with him if your lasse
interpretation should abuse and call this
your lacke of loue or bounty you were straited
for a reply at least if you make a care
of happie holding her

flo old sir i know
she prizes not such trifles as these are
the gifts she lookes from me are packt and lockt
vp in my heart which i haue giuen already
but not deliuer 'd o heare me breath my life
before this ancient sir whom it should seeme
hath sometime lou 'd i take thy hand this hand
as soft as doues-downe and as white as it
or ethyopians tooth or the fan 'd snow that 's bolted
by th northerne blasts twice ore

pol what followes this
how prettily th yong swaine seemes to wash
the hand was faire before i haue put you out
but to your protestation let me heare

pol soft swaine a-while beseech you

pol me-thinkes a father
is at the nuptiall of his sonne a guest
that best becomes the table pray you once more
is not your father growne incapeable
of reasonable affayres is he not stupid
with age and altring rheumes can he speake heare
know man from man dispute his owne estate
lies he not bed-rid and againe do 's nothing
but what he did being childish
flo no good sir
he has his health and ampler strength indeede
then most haue of his age

pol by my white beard
you offer him if this be so a wrong
something vnfilliall reason my sonne
should choose himselfe a wife but as good reason
the father all whose ioy is nothing else
but faire posterity should hold some counsaile
in such a businesse

flo i yeeld all this
but for some other reasons my graue sir
which 't is not fit you know i not acquaint
my father of this businesse

pol let him know't

flo he shall not

pol prethee let him

flo no he must not

shep let him my sonne he shall not need to greeue
at knowing of thy choice

flo come come he must not
marke our contract

pol marke your diuorce yong sir
whom sonne i dare not call thou art too base
to be acknowledge thou a scepters heire
that thus affects a sheepe-hooke thou old traitor
i am sorry that by hanging thee i can
but shorten thy life one weeke and thou fresh peece
of excellent witchcraft whom of force must know
the royall foole thou coap'st with

shep oh my heart

pol ile haue thy beauty scratcht with briers made
more homely then thy state for thee fond boy
if i may euer know thou dost but sigh
that thou no more shalt neuer see this knacke as neuer
i meane thou shalt wee l barre thee from succession
not hold thee of our blood no not our kin
farre then deucalion off marke thou my words
follow vs to the court thou churle for this time
though full of our displeasure yet we free thee
from the dead blow of it and you enchantment
worthy enough a heardsman yea him too
that makes himselfe but for our honor therein
vnworthy thee if euer henceforth thou
these rurall latches to his entrance open
or hope his body more with thy embraces
i will deuise a death as cruell for thee
as thou art tender to't
enter

perd euen heere vndone
i was not much a-fear 'd for once or twice
i was about to speake and tell him plainely
the selfe-same sun that shines vpon his court
hides not his visage from our cottage but
lookes on alike wilt please you sir be gone
i told you what would come of this beseech you
of your owne state take care this dreame of mine
being now awake ile queene it no inch farther
but milke my ewes and weepe

cam why how now father
speake ere thou dyest

shep i can not speake nor thinke
nor dare to know that which i know o sir
you haue vndone a man of fourescore three
that thought to fill his graue in quiet yea
to dye vpon the bed my father dy'de
to lye close by his honest bones but now
some hangman must put on my shrowd and lay me
where no priest shouels-in dust oh cursed wretch
that knew'st this was the prince and wouldst aduenture
to mingle faith with him vndone vndone
if i might dye within this houre i haue liu 'd
to die when i desire
enter

flo why looke you so vpon me
i am but sorry not affear 'd delaid
but nothing altred what i was i am
more straining on for plucking backe not following
my leash vnwillingly

cam gracious my lord
you know my fathers temper at this time
he will allow no speech which i do ghesse
you do not purpose to him and as hardly
will he endure your sight as yet i feare
then till the fury of his highnesse settle
come not before him

flo i not purpose it
i thinke camillo

cam euen he my lord

per how often haue i told you 'twould be thus
how often said my dignity would last
but till 'twer knowne
flo it can not faile but by
the violation of my faith and then
let nature crush the sides o'th earth together
and marre the seeds within lift vp thy lookes
from my succession wipe me father i
am heyre to my affection

cam be aduis 'd

flo i am and by my fancie if my reason
will thereto be obedient i haue reason
if not my sences better pleas 'd with madnesse
do bid it welcome

cam this is desperate sir
flo so call it but it do 's fulfill my vow
i needs must thinke it honesty camillo
not for bohemia nor the pompe that may
be thereat gleaned for all the sun sees or
the close earth wombes or the profound seas hides
in vnknowne fadomes will i breake my oath
to this my faire belou 'd therefore i pray you
as you haue euer bin my fathers honour 'd friend
when he shall misse me as in faith i meane not
to see him any more cast your good counsailes
vpon his passion let my selfe and fortune
tug for the time to come this you may know
and so deliuer i am put to sea
with her who heere i can not hold on shore
and most opportune to her neede i haue
a vessell rides fast by but not prepar 'd
for this designe what course i meane to hold
shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor
concerne me the reporting

cam o my lord
i would your spirit were easier for aduice
or stronger for your neede

flo hearke perdita
ile heare you by and by

cam hee 's irremoueable
resolu 'd for flight now were i happy if
his going i could frame to serue my turne
saue him from danger do him loue and honor
purchase the sight againe of deere sicillia
and that vnhappy king my master whom
i so much thirst to see

flo now good camillo
i am so fraught with curious businesse that
i leaue out ceremony

cam sir i thinke
you haue heard of my poore seruices i'th loue
that i haue borne your father
flo very nobly
haue you deseru 'd it is my fathers musicke
to speake your deeds not little of his care
to haue them recompenc 'd as thought on

cam well my lord
if you may please to thinke i loue the king
and through him what 's neerest to him which is
your gracious selfe embrace but my direction
if your more ponderous and setled proiect
may suffer alteration on mine honor
ile point you where you shall haue such receiuing
as shall become your highnesse where you may
enioy your mistris from the whom i see
there 's no disiunction to be made but by
as heauens forefend your ruine marry her
and with my best endeuours in your absence
your discontenting father striue to qualifie
and bring him vp to liking

flo how camillo
may this almost a miracle be done
that i may call thee something more then man
and after that trust to thee

cam haue you thought on
a place whereto you l go
flo not any yet
but as th vnthought-on accident is guiltie
to what we wildely do so we professe
our selues to be the slaues of chance and flyes
of euery winde that blowes

cam then list to me
this followes if you will not change your purpose
but vndergo this flight make for sicillia
and there present your selfe and your fayre princesse
for so i see she must be 'fore leontes
she shall be habited as it becomes
the partner of your bed me thinkes i see
leontes opening his free armes and weeping
his welcomes forth asks thee there sonne forgiuenesse
as 'twere i'th fathers person kisses the hands
of your fresh princesse ore and ore diuides him
'twixt his vnkindnesse and his kindnesse th one
he chides to hell and bids the other grow
faster then thought or time

flo worthy camillo
what colour for my visitation shall i
hold vp before him
cam sent by the king your father
to greet him and to giue him comforts sir
the manner of your bearing towards him with
what you as from your father shall deliuer
things knowne betwixt vs three ile write you downe
the which shall point you forth at euery sitting
what you must say that he shall not perceiue
but that you haue your fathers bosome there
and speake his very heart

flo i am bound to you
there is some sappe in this

cam a course more promising
then a wild dedication of your selues
to vnpath 'd waters vndream 'd shores most certaine
to miseries enough no hope to helpe you
but as you shake off one to take another
nothing so certaine as your anchors who
doe their best office if they can but stay you
where you'le be loth to be besides you know
prosperitie 's the very bond of loue
whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
affliction alters

perd one of these is true
i thinke affliction may subdue the cheeke
but not take-in the mind

cam yea say you so
there shall not at your fathers house these seuen yeeres
be borne another such

flo my good camillo
she 's as forward of her breeding as
she is i'th reare our birth

cam i can not say 't is pitty
she lacks instructions for she seemes a mistresse
to most that teach

perd your pardon sir for this
ile blush you thanks

flo my prettiest perdita
but o the thornes we stand vpon camillo
preseruer of my father now of me
the medicine of our house how shall we doe
we are not furnish 'd like bohemia 's sonne
nor shall appeare in sicilia

cam my lord

to haue you royally appointed as if
the scene you play were mine for instance sir
that you may know you shall not want one word

't was nothing to gueld a cod-peece of a purse i
would haue fill 'd keyes of that hung in chaynes no
hearing no feeling but my sirs song and admiring the
nothing of it so that in this time of lethargie i pickd
and cut most of their festiuall purses and had not the
old-man come in with a whoo-bub against his daughter

aut i vnderstand the businesse i heare it to haue an

worke for th other sences i see this is the time that the
vniust man doth thriue what an exchange had this been
without boot what a boot is here with this exchange
sure the gods doe this yeere conniue at vs and we may
doe any thing extempore the prince himselfe is about
a peece of iniquitie stealing away from his father with
his clog at his heeles if i thought it were a peece of honestie
to acquaint the king withall i would not do't i
hold it the more knauerie to conceale it and therein am
i constant to my profession
enter clowne and shepheard

aside aside here is more matter for a hot braine euery
lanes end euery shop church session hanging yeelds
a carefull man worke

clowne see see what a man you are now there is no
other way but to tell the king she 's a changeling and
none of your flesh and blood

shep nay but heare me

clow nay but heare me

shep goe too then

clow she being none of your flesh and blood your
flesh and blood ha 's not offended the king and so your
flesh and blood is not to be punish 'd by him shew those
things you found about her those secret things all but
what she ha 's with her this being done let the law goe
whistle i warrant you

shep i will tell the king all euery word yea and his
sonnes prancks too who i may say is no honest man
neither to his father nor to me to goe about to make me
the kings brother in law

clow indeed brother in law was the farthest off you
could haue beene to him and then your blood had beene
the dearer by i know how much an ounce

aut very wisely puppies
shep well let vs to the king there is that in this
farthell will make him scratch his beard

aut i know not what impediment this complaint
may be to the flight of my master

clo 'pray heartily he be at pallace

aut though i am not naturally honest i am so sometimes
by chance let me pocket vp my pedlers excrement
how now rustiques whither are you bound
shep to th pallace and it like your worship
aut your affaires there what with whom the
condition of that farthell the place of your dwelling
your names your ages of what hauing breeding and
any thing that is fitting to be knowne discouer
clo we are but plaine fellowes sir

aut a lye you are rough and hayrie let me haue
no lying it becomes none but trades-men and they often
giue vs souldiers the lye but wee pay them for it
with stamped coyne not stabbing steele therefore they
doe not giue vs the lye

clo your worship had like to haue giuen vs one if
you had not taken your selfe with the manner

shep are you a courtier and't like you sir
aut whether it like me or no i am a courtier seest
thou not the ayre of the court in these enfoldings hath
not my gate in it the measure of the court receiues not
thy nose court-odour from me reflect i not on thy
basenesse court-contempt think'st thou for that i
insinuate at toaze from thee thy businesse i am therefore
no courtier i am courtier capape and one that
will eyther push-on or pluck-back thy businesse there
whereupon i command thee to open thy affaire

shep my businesse sir is to the king

aut what aduocate ha'st thou to him
shep i know not and't like you
clo aduocate 's the court-word for a pheazant say
you haue none

shep none sir i haue no pheazant cock nor hen

aut how blessed are we that are not simple men
yet nature might haue made me as these are
therefore i will not disdaine

clo this can not be but a great courtier

shep his garments are rich but he weares them not
handsomely

clo he seemes to be the more noble in being fantasticall
a great man ile warrant i know by the picking
on 's teeth

aut the farthell there what 's i'th farthell
wherefore that box
shep sir there lyes such secrets in this farthell and
box which none must know but the king and which hee
shall know within this houre if i may come to th speech
of him

aut age thou hast lost thy labour

shep why sir
aut the king is not at the pallace he is gone aboord
a new ship to purge melancholy and ayre himselfe for
if thou bee'st capable of things serious thou must know
the king is full of griefe

shep so 't is said sir about his sonne that should
haue marryed a shepheards daughter

aut if that shepheard be not in hand-fast let him
flye the curses he shall haue the tortures he shall feele
will breake the back of man the heart of monster

clo thinke you so sir
aut not hee alone shall suffer what wit can make
heauie and vengeance bitter but those that are iermaine
to him though remou 'd fiftie times shall all come vnder
the hang-man which though it be great pitty yet it is
necessarie an old sheepe-whistling rogue a ram-tender
to offer to haue his daughter come into grace some
say hee shall be ston 'd but that death is too soft for him
say i draw our throne into a sheep-coat all deaths
are too few the sharpest too easie

clo ha 's the old-man ere a sonne sir doe you heare
and't like you sir
aut hee ha 's a sonne who shall be flayd aliue then
'noynted ouer with honey set on the head of a waspes
nest then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead
then recouer 'd againe with aquavite or some other hot
infusion then raw as he is and in the hotest day prognostication
proclaymes shall he be set against a brick-wall
the sunne looking with a south-ward eye vpon him
where hee is to behold him with flyes blown to death
but what talke we of these traitorly-rascals whose miseries
are to be smil 'd at their offences being so capitall
tell me for you seeme to be honest plaine men what you
haue to the king being something gently consider 'd ile
bring you where he is aboord tender your persons to his
presence whisper him in your behalfes and if it be in
man besides the king to effect your suites here is man
shall doe it

clow he seemes to be of great authoritie close with
him giue him gold and though authoritie be a stubborne
beare yet hee is oft led by the nose with gold
shew the in-side of your purse to the out-side of his
hand and no more adoe remember ston 'd and flay 'd
aliue

shep and't please you sir to vndertake the businesse
for vs here is that gold i haue ile make it as much
more and leaue this young man in pawne till i bring it
you

aut after i haue done what i promised
shep i sir

aut well giue me the moitie are you a partie in
this businesse
clow in some sort sir but though my case be a pittifull
one i hope i shall not be flayd out of it

aut oh that 's the case of the shepheards sonne
hang him hee'le be made an example

clow comfort good comfort we must to the king
and shew our strange sights he must know 't is none of
your daughter nor my sister wee are gone else sir i
will giue you as much as this old man do 's when the businesse
is performed and remaine as he sayes your pawne
till it be brought you

aut i will trust you walke before toward the seaside
goe on the right hand i will but looke vpon the
hedge and follow you

clow we are bless 'd in this man as i may say euen
bless 'd

shep let 's before as he bids vs he was prouided to
doe vs good

aut if i had a mind to be honest i see fortune would
not suffer mee shee drops booties in my mouth i am
courted now with a double occasion gold and a means
to doe the prince my master good which who knowes
how that may turne backe to my aduancement i will
bring these two moales these blind-ones aboord him if
he thinke it fit to shoare them againe and that the complaint
they haue to the king concernes him nothing let
him call me rogue for being so farre officious for i am
proofe against that title and what shame else belongs
to't to him will i present them there may be matter in
it

actus quintus scena prima

enter leontes cleomines dion paulina seruants florizel
perdita

cleo sir you haue done enough and haue perform 'd
a saint-like sorrow no fault could you make
which you haue not redeem 'd indeed pay 'd downe
more penitence then done trespas at the last
doe as the heauens haue done forget your euill
with them forgiue your selfe

leo whilest i remember
her and her vertues i can not forget
my blemishes in them and so still thinke of
the wrong i did my selfe which was so much
that heire-lesse it hath made my kingdome and
destroy 'd the sweet'st companion that ere man
bred his hopes out of true

paul too true my lord
if one by one you wedded all the world
or from the all that are tooke something good
to make a perfect woman she you kill 'd
would be vnparallell 'd

leo i thinke so kill 'd
she i kill 'd i did so but thou strik'st me
sorely to say i did it is as bitter
vpon thy tongue as in my thought now good now
say so but seldome

cleo not at all good lady
you might haue spoken a thousand things that would
haue done the time more benefit and grac 'd
your kindnesse better

paul you are one of those
would haue him wed againe

dio if you would not so
you pitty not the state nor the remembrance
of his most soueraigne name consider little
what dangers by his highnesse faile of issue
may drop vpon his kingdome and deuoure
incertaine lookers on what were more holy
then to reioyce the former queene is well
what holyer then for royalties repayre
for present comfort and for future good
to blesse the bed of maiestie againe
with a sweet fellow to't
paul there is none worthy
respecting her that 's gone besides the gods
will haue fulfill 'd their secret purposes
for ha 's not the diuine apollo said
is't not the tenor of his oracle
that king leontes shall not haue an heire
till his lost child be found which that it shall
is all as monstrous to our humane reason
as my antigonus to breake his graue
and come againe to me who on my life
did perish with the infant 't is your councell
my lord should to the heauens be contrary
oppose against their wills care not for issue
the crowne will find an heire great alexander
left his to th worthiest so his successor
was like to be the best

leo good paulina
who hast the memorie of hermione
i know in honor o that euer i
had squar 'd me to thy councell then euen now
i might haue look 'd vpon my queenes full eyes
haue taken treasure from her lippes

paul and left them
more rich for what they yeelded

leo thou speak'st truth
no more such wiues therefore no wife one worse
and better vs 'd would make her sainted spirit
againe possesse her corps and on this stage
where we offendors now appeare soule-vext
and begin why to me
paul had she such power
she had iust such cause

leo she had and would incense me
to murther her i marryed

paul i should so
were i the ghost that walk 'd il 'd bid you marke
her eye and tell me for what dull part i n't
you chose her then il 'd shrieke that euen your eares
should rift to heare me and the words that follow 'd
should be remember mine

leo starres starres
and all eyes else dead coales feare thou no wife
ile haue no wife paulina

paul will you sweare
neuer to marry but by my free leaue
leo neuer paulina so be bless 'd my spirit

paul then good my lords beare witnesse to his oath

cleo you tempt him ouer-much

paul vnlesse another
as like hermione as is her picture
affront his eye

cleo good madame i haue done

paul yet if my lord will marry if you will sir
no remedie but you will giue me the office
to chuse you a queene she shall not be so young
as was your former but she shall be such
as walk 'd your first queenes ghost it should take ioy
to see her in your armes

leo my true paulina
we shall not marry till thou bidst vs

paul that
shall be when your first queene 's againe in breath
neuer till then
enter a seruant

ser one that giues out himselfe prince florizell
sonne of polixenes with his princesse she
the fairest i haue yet beheld desires accesse
to your high presence

leo what with him he comes not
like to his fathers greatnesse his approach
so out of circumstance and suddaine tells vs

scoena secunda


enter autolicus and a gentleman

aut beseech you sir were you present at this relation
gent.1 i was by at the opening of the farthell heard
the old shepheard deliuer the manner how he found it
whereupon after a little amazednesse we were all commanded
out of the chamber onely this me thought i
heard the shepheard say he found the child

aut i would most gladly know the issue of it

gent.1 i make a broken deliuerie of the businesse
but the changes i perceiued in the king and camillo were
very notes of admiration they seem 'd almost with staring
on one another to teare the cases of their eyes
there was speech in their dumbnesse language in their
very gesture they look 'd as they had heard of a world
ransom 'd or one destroyed a notable passion of wonder
appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew
no more but seeing could not say if th importance were
ioy or sorrow but in the extremitie of the one it must
needs be
enter another gentleman

here comes a gentleman that happily knowes more
the newes rogero

gent.2 nothing but bon-fires the oracle is fulfill 'd
the kings daughter is found such a deale of wonder is
broken out within this houre that ballad-makers can not
be able to expresse it
enter another gentleman

here comes the lady paulina 's steward hee can deliuer
you more how goes it now sir this newes which
is call 'd true is so like an old tale that the veritie of it is
in strong suspition ha 's the king found his heire
gent.3 most true if euer truth were pregnant by
circumstance that which you heare you'le sweare
you see there is such vnitie in the proofes the mantle
of queene hermiones her iewell about the neck of it
the letters of antigonus found with it which they know
to be his character the maiestie of the creature in resemblance
of the mother the affection of noblenesse
which nature shewes aboue her breeding and many other
euidences proclayme her with all certaintie to be
the kings daughter did you see the meeting of the
two kings
gent.2 no

gent.3 then haue you lost a sight which was to bee
seene can not bee spoken of there might you haue beheld
one ioy crowne another so and in such manner that
it seem 'd sorrow wept to take leaue of them for their
ioy waded in teares there was casting vp of eyes holding
vp of hands with countenance of such distraction
that they were to be knowne by garment not by fauor
our king being ready to leape out of himselfe for ioy of
his found daughter as if that ioy were now become a
losse cryes oh thy mother thy mother then askes
bohemia forgiuenesse then embraces his sonne-in-law
then againe worryes he his daughter with clipping her
now he thanks the old shepheard which stands by like
a weather-bitten conduit of many kings reignes i
neuer heard of such another encounter which lames report
to follow it and vndo 's description to doe it

gent.2 what 'pray you became of antigonus that
carryed hence the child
gent.3 like an old tale still which will haue matter
to rehearse though credit be asleepe and not an eare open
he was torne to pieces with a beare this auouches
the shepheards sonne who ha 's not onely his innocence
which seemes much to iustifie him but a hand-kerchief
and rings of his that paulina knowes

gent.1 what became of his barke and his followers
gent.3 wrackt the same instant of their masters
death and in the view of the shepheard so that all the
instruments which ayded to expose the child were euen
then lost when it was found but oh the noble combat
that 'twixt ioy and sorrow was fought in paulina shee
had one eye declin 'd for the losse of her husband another
eleuated that the oracle was fulfill 'd shee lifted the
princesse from the earth and so locks her in embracing
as if shee would pin her to her heart that shee might no
more be in danger of loosing

gent.1 the dignitie of this act was worth the audience
of kings and princes for by such was it acted

gent.3 one of the prettyest touches of all and that
which angl 'd for mine eyes caught the water though
not the fish was when at the relation of the queenes
death with the manner how shee came to't brauely confess 'd
and lamented by the king how attentiuenesse
wounded his daughter till from one signe of dolour to
another shee did with an alas i would faine say bleed
teares for i am sure my heart wept blood who was
most marble there changed colour some swownded all
sorrowed if all the world could haue see n't the woe
had beene vniuersall

gent.1 are they returned to the court
gent.3 no the princesse hearing of her mothers
statue which is in the keeping of paulina a peece many
yeeres in doing and now newly perform 'd by that rare
italian master iulio romano who had he himselfe eternitie
and could put breath into his worke would beguile
nature of her custome so perfectly he is her ape
he so neere to hermione hath done hermione that they
say one would speake to her and stand in hope of answer
thither with all greedinesse of affection are they gone
and there they intend to sup

gent.2 i thought she had some great matter there in
hand for shee hath priuately twice or thrice a day euer
since the death of hermione visited that remoued house
shall wee thither and with our companie peece the reioycing
gent.1 who would be thence that ha 's the benefit
of accesse euery winke of an eye some new grace
will be borne our absence makes vs vnthriftie to our
knowledge let 's along

aut now had i not the dash of my former life in
me would preferment drop on my head i brought the
old man and his sonne aboord the prince told him i
heard them talke of a farthell and i know not what but
he at that time ouer-fond of the shepheards daughter so
he then tooke her to be who began to be much sea-sick
and himselfe little better extremitie of weather continuing
this mysterie remained vndiscouer 'd but 't is all
one to me for had i beene the finder-out of this secret
it would not haue rellish 'd among my other discredits
enter shepheard and clowne

here come those i haue done good to against my will
and alreadie appearing in the blossomes of their fortune

shep come boy i am past moe children but thy
sonnes and daughters will be all gentlemen borne

clow you are well met sir you deny 'd to fight
with mee this other day because i was no gentleman
borne see you these clothes say you see them not
and thinke me still no gentleman borne you were best
say these robes are not gentlemen borne giue me the
lye doe and try whether i am not now a gentleman
borne

aut i know you are now sir a gentleman borne

clow i and haue been so any time these foure houres

shep and so haue i boy

clow so you haue but i was a gentleman borne before
my father for the kings sonne tooke me by the
hand and call 'd mee brother and then the two kings
call 'd my father brother and then the prince my brother
and the princesse my sister call 'd my father father
and so wee wept and there was the first gentleman-like
teares that euer we shed

shep we may liue sonne to shed many more

clow i or else 'twere hard luck being in so preposterous
estate as we are

aut i humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the
faults i haue committed to your worship and to giue
me your good report to the prince my master

shep 'prethee sonne doe for we must be gentle now
we are gentlemen

clow thou wilt amend thy life

clow if it be ne 're so false a true gentleman may
sweare it in the behalfe of his friend and ile sweare to
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that
thou wilt not be drunke but i know thou art no tall fellow
of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunke but ile

thy hands

aut i will proue so sir to my power

excells what euer yet you look 'd vpon

i like your silence it the more shewes-off
your wonder but yet speake first you my liege
comes it not something neere
leo her naturall posture
chide me deare stone that i may say indeed
thou art hermione or rather thou art she
in thy not chiding for she was as tender
as infancie and grace but yet paulina
hermione was not so much wrinckled nothing
so aged as this seemes

pol oh not by much

paul so much the more our caruers excellence
which lets goe-by some sixteene yeeres and makes her
as she liu 'd now

leo as now she might haue done
so much to my good comfort as it is
now piercing to my soule oh thus she stood
euen with such life of maiestie warme life
as now it coldly stands when first i woo 'd her
i am asham 'd do 's not the stone rebuke me
for being more stone then it oh royall peece
there 's magick in thy maiestie which ha 's
my euils coniur 'd to remembrance and
from thy admiring daughter tooke the spirits
standing like stone with thee

perd and giue me leaue
and doe not say 't is superstition that
i kneele and then implore her blessing lady
deere queene that ended when i but began
giue me that hand of yours to kisse

paul o patience
the statue is but newly fix 'd the colour 's
not dry

cam my lord your sorrow was too sore lay'd-on
which sixteene winters can not blow away
so many summers dry scarce any ioy
did euer so long liue no sorrow
but kill 'd it selfe much sooner

pol deere my brother
let him that was the cause of this haue powre
to take-off so much griefe from you as he
will peece vp in himselfe

paul indeed my lord
if i had thought the sight of my poore image
would thus haue wrought you for the stone is mine

leo doe not draw the curtaine

paul no longer shall you gaze o n't least your fancie
may thinke anon it moues

what was he that did make it see my lord
would you not deeme it breath 'd and that those veines
did verily beare blood
pol 'masterly done
the very life seemes warme vpon her lippe

leo the fixure of her eye ha 's motion i n't

my lord 's almost so farre transported that
hee'le thinke anon it liues

leo oh sweet paulina
make me to thinke so twentie yeeres together
no setled sences of the world can match
the pleasure of that madnesse let't alone

paul i am sorry sir i haue thus farre stir 'd you but
i could afflict you farther

leo doe paulina
for this affliction ha 's a taste as sweet
as any cordiall comfort still me thinkes
there is an ayre comes from her what fine chizzell
could euer yet cut breath let no man mock me
for i will kisse her

paul good my lord forbeare
the ruddinesse vpon her lippe is wet
you'le marre it if you kisse it stayne your owne
with oyly painting shall i draw the curtaine

leo no not these twentie yeeres

perd so long could i
stand-by a looker-on

paul either forbeare
quit presently the chappell or resolue you
for more amazement if you can behold it
ile make the statue moue indeed descend
and take you by the hand but then you'le thinke
which i protest against i am assisted
by wicked powers

leo what you can make her doe
i am content to looke on what to speake
i am content to heare for 't is as easie
to make her speake as moue

paul it is requir 'd
you doe awake your faith then all stand still
on those that thinke it is vnlawfull businesse
i am about let them depart

leo proceed
no foot shall stirre

paul musick awake her strike
't is time descend be stone no more approach
strike all that looke vpon with meruaile come
ile fill your graue vp stirre nay come away
bequeath to death your numnesse for from him
deare life redeemes you you perceiue she stirres
start not her actions shall be holy as
you heare my spell is lawfull doe not shun her
vntill you see her dye againe for then
you kill her double nay present your hand
when she was young you woo 'd her now in age
is she become the suitor
leo oh she 's warme
if this be magick let it be an art
lawfull as eating

pol she embraces him

cam she hangs about his necke
if she pertaine to life let her speake too

pol i and make it manifest where she ha 's liu 'd
or how stolne from the dead
paul that she is liuing
were it but told you should be hooted at
like an old tale but it appeares she liues
though yet she speake not marke a little while
please you to interpose faire madam kneele
and pray your mothers blessing turne good lady
our perdita is found

her you gods looke downe
and from your sacred viols poure your graces
vpon my daughters head tell me mine owne
where hast thou bin preseru 'd where liu 'd how found
thy fathers court for thou shalt heare that i
knowing by paulina that the oracle
gaue hope thou wast in being haue preseru 'd
my selfe to see the yssue

paul there 's time enough for that
least they desire vpon this push to trouble
your ioyes with like relation go together
you precious winners all your exultation

will wing me to some wither 'd bough and there
my mate that 's neuer to be found againe

thou shouldst a husband take by my consent
as i by thine a wife this is a match

but how is to be question 'd for i saw her
as i thought dead and haue in vaine said many
