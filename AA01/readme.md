# Practical Work Number 1

For this assignmente it was required to build a graph generator with n vertexs and a random number of edges per vertex. The final Challange was to build both and exhaustive and greedy algorithms to find the maximum independent set of a given graph.

Graph.py:
```
    This module builds graphs. It is also able to serialize the Vertex and Edge objects to json to save and load them. To see the usage run the module without arguments!
```
GraphsGenerator.py:
```
    This script is useful to generate a lot of graphs in one go. The parameter passed, vertex_limit, is the last graph vertex count. It generates all the graphs from 1 vertex to vertex_limit.
```
